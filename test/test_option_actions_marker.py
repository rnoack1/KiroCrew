"""``[OPTION-ACTIONS:]`` — the grammar, the non-collision, and every strip site.

The new marker is acted on ONLY by the dashboard frontend. Every backend parser
keys on the literal ``[OPTIONS:``, so the new head is INERT for them — and
inert is not harmless: a parser that does not match a marker does not mangle it,
it passes it through VERBATIM as visible text. So the marker leaks raw into Slack,
into the sidebar preview, and — worst — is READ ALOUD by TTS, where the artefact
cannot be scrolled past or re-rendered.

Two properties are pinned here, and the second is the one the whole design rests
on:

1. Every surface STRIPS the marker, and non-dashboard surfaces strip-and-DROP it —
   no widget, no choice. A Slack or Discord button cannot close a dashboard tab,
   so a button built from an action entry would be a button that lies.
2. The two heads NEVER parse each other's markers, in BOTH directions. If that
   ever breaks, an action label becomes a channel button label (free text fed back
   into the session as if the user typed it), or a content choice is silently
   swallowed. Both failures are silent: the regex matches, the anchor is
   satisfied, and only the captured label is wrong.

Every strip-site test carries a paired REGRESSION assertion that an ordinary
``[OPTIONS:]`` marker still behaves exactly as before, because the cheapest way to
make a marker stop leaking is to break the marker that was already working.
