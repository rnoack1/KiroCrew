"""Undrained pending context survives a close, a reopen, and a gateway restart.

`slot._pending_context` was in-memory ONLY. Nothing serialized it, and the close
path pops the slot from `state._slots`, so an entry a producer was told was
accepted (a 200 from `/context` or `/note`) was discarded with no trace on any
surface. `/note` at least leaves its visible half behind; `/context` is
context-only, so its content vanished outright.

These tests pin the round trip through a REAL ConversationLog (`_make_state`
supplies one), so they exercise the actual metadata line rather than a mock of
it. `test_close_then_rehydrate_recovers_context` is the one that fails on an
unfixed tree.

The clearing test matters as much as the recovery test: `pending_context` is a
SLOT-OWNED metadata key, so absence means "cleared". That is what retires the
persisted copy once the next user message drains the queue -- and it is why the
save writes the key on every save rather than only on close, since a non-close
save that omitted it would clear a copy an earlier close had written.

FOUR HYDRATION SITES exist for a slot-owned key, and each is covered here, because
seating the key at only some of them is worse than incompleteness: on an uncovered
path the slot hydrates with an empty queue and the next forced save DELETES the
stored copy.
