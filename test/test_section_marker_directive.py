"""``section_marker`` — the stateless directive that draws a labelled chapter
break in the calling session's transcript.

The row is HELD to a turn boundary rather than appended inline, and the reason is
positional rather than about teardown. A turn builds its prompt with
``exclude_last_n=1`` so the current turn's user message is not fed back as
history, and that exclusion is a raw positional slice applied BEFORE role
filtering — so a row appended after the current-turn user row becomes the
physical tail, absorbs the exclusion, and the user's message survives the slice
and is replayed. Keeping the role out of ``RECALL_ROLES`` does not rescue that:
membership decides whether the row itself is replayed, never which row the slice
removes. So the marker rides ``/note``'s existing hold instead of inventing a
second notion of "held".

These tests pin the tool's payload and descriptor, the applier's queuing and its
refusals, the flushed row's shape (role, label under ``meta``, no context half),
the shared per-turn cap, and the recall exclusion.

The flush seams themselves — that a held row is written at the end of a turn
rather than mid-turn — are ``chat_runner._start_next_queued_turn`` and
``_finish_queue_cycle``, covered by the ``/note`` deferral tests in
``test_gateway_appkit_endpoints.py``; this file pins that a marker lands in the
same hold those seams drain.
