    Resolution is deliberately wider than enumeration -- it also accepts a bare leaf name
    through the nested tier -- so a derivation computed RELATIVE to the candidate set is a
    phantom-row generator: the segment that uniquely named a root among two holders names
    something else among three, and the enumerated key then binds to no root.

    Pinned separately from the invariant test above because it fixes the layout where the
    two readings differ MOST: roots spelled ``packages/<Pkg>/<event>/skills``, where a
    root's distinguishing segment (``PkgA``) and its parent (``eventId-1``) are both
    plausible qualifiers, plus a third root joining ONLY through the nested-leaf glob while
    itself carrying ``PkgA``, plus an alias root the enumerator folds away by resolved
    identity. A shallower fixture cannot separate the two readings.

    It holds because the qualifier is a digest of the root's OWN canonical path.
