    Asserting the ``package/`` prefix instead would pass vacuously under any key
    change — a false all-clear on exactly the property being changed. So each key
    is handed back to the resolver and compared to the file it was enumerated for.

    The fixture carries the two root shapes that make the invariant NON-TRIVIAL, because
    they are the two ways the resolver's collision set can drift from the enumerator's:

    * a NESTED-LEAF root (``<root>/<Pkg>/<rel>/SKILL.md``, the documented tier-2
      layout), which the resolver would see as a holder of ``<rel>`` if it counted the
      ``*/{name}`` tier — while the fold's collision unit is the walked rel, so it
      counts it as a separate, non-colliding entry; and
    * a SYMLINK-ALIAS root reaching another root's copy, which the fold collapses to one
      COPY and therefore keys unqualified; and
    * a root sharing EVERY segment with a sibling, the layout the description's claim about
      "no segment tells the colliding roots apart" is about. A segment rule cannot address
      it, so the whole collision was unqualifiable and the rel was omitted; a per-root
      digest keys it like any other, and asserting that HERE rather than only on the
      collision helper is what makes the invariant end-to-end over that layout.

    Either one, if admitted, widens the set the qualifier is derived against, so a
    segment that uniquely identified a holder at enumeration time stops being unique at
    resolve time and the derivation shifts deeper or to ``None`` — the enumerated key
    then matches no root and 404s. Without these two roots the test passes while the
    guarantee is false, since the remaining fixtures have disjoint distinguishing
    segments and so cannot expose the drift.
