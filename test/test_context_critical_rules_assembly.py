"""Tests for the assembled critical-rules blocks.

`_CRITICAL_RULES_TAIL` is shared by the dashboard and channel blocks, so a rule
appended to it reaches both surfaces. The recommended-option marker must reach
only the dashboard: a channel renderer sends a chosen option label verbatim as
the user's next message, so an agent told to write `(recommended)` there would
put the marker into the user's own words. These tests pin that split, and pin
that splitting the terminator out of the shared tail did not drop a rule or
leave the block unterminated.
