"""Every reserved provenance opener a dispatcher byte-matches must be one the strip refuses.

The bracket guard used to refuse ANY leading ``[``, which made a legitimate label such as
``(recommended) [Draft] Reword it`` decline the strip -- so the marker stayed in the chip
as raw protocol text AND in the dispatched string, which is the harm this grammar exists
to prevent. The guard now mirrors the actual openers instead, and this test is what keeps
the mirror faithful in both directions: a new opener in the dashboard fails here, and a
reserved entry no dispatcher matches fails too.
