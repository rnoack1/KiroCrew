"""A spent OPTIONS record renders NO recommendation, and the value is still threaded.

Two separate contracts, and the distinction is the point.

RENDER: the struck-through record of a superseded turn shows no marker. Nothing on it can
be acted on, so a marker would buy a reader nothing while re-introducing the raw
``(recommended)`` text that the rest of this path keeps out of what a reader sees.

THREAD: the backfill still carries the value to the options sink rather than discarding it
at the parse. The live control renders it; the spent record chooses not to. Those are
different decisions, and dropping the value at the parse would remove the choice.
