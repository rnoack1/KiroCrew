"""Tests for ``/note`` channel delivery (``chat_note_mirror``).

The context half of a note is surface-agnostic (``drain_pending_context`` runs in
``_run_chat``, which every inbound surface shares) while the visible half went to
the dashboard only. These pin the leg that closes that gap: the note's visible
line reaches the Slack thread or the non-Slack channel a session is bound to, and
is a silent no-op for a dashboard-only session, a paused mirror, an ungoverned
egress, a non-proactive transport and an unresolvable link.

No live channel is required: the Slack leg takes a stub client and the neutral
leg takes a fake ``MessagingTransport`` through the real send ladder, so the
nine transports that cannot be reached from a corporate network are still
covered by the same assertions as Slack.

    turn on it, and production learns it from the log rather than from a return

    the deleted list was built from -- preserving the old assertions exactly, with

    """A permit is ceiling ∩ profile, so the guard must watch both halves.

    ``governance_permits`` resolves the boot-frozen ceiling intersected with the
    surface's active profile. The profile layer reloads from disk on an mtime change
    and publishes a new snapshot WITHOUT installing a context, so the ceiling counter
    cannot move for a profile-only tightening. A guard reading that counter alone
    therefore reports "unchanged" for a profile withdrawn inside the await window,
    and the note posts on a permit its own profile layer has already revoked.

    ``governance_answer_generation`` closes it by comparing the composite. These
    tests hold the CEILING half constant on purpose: a change that moved the ceiling
    would refuse on the old code too, so only a moved profile half under a still
    ceiling can discriminate this fix from its absence.

    The moved half is driven by an ADVANCING counter rather than by a bump inside the
    permit gate, because that gate is called more than once per send (a pre-flight
    hop plus the one inside the authority read), so a bump there depends on the call
    count rather than on the window under test.
