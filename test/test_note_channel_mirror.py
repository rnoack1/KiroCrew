"""Tests for ``/note`` channel delivery (``chat_note_mirror``).

The context half of a note is surface-agnostic (``drain_pending_context`` runs in
``_run_chat``, which every inbound surface shares) while the visible half went to
the dashboard only. These pin the leg that closes that gap: the note's visible
line reaches the Slack thread or the non-Slack channel a session is bound to, and
is a silent no-op for a dashboard-only session, a paused mirror, an ungoverned
egress, a non-proactive transport and an unresolvable link.

No live channel is required: the Slack leg takes a stub client and the neutral
leg takes a fake ``MessagingTransport`` through the real send ladder, so the
nine transports that cannot be reached from a corporate network are still
covered by the same assertions as Slack.
