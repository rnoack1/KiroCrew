"""An OPTIONS click sends MODEL-AUTHORED text, so it must not be run as a command.

The Slack option callbacks dispatch the label the model wrote. A leading command token
there is ordinary turn content: interpreting it would let a reply arrange its own
privilege escalation (``!yolo`` turns on process-wide auto-approval) by writing an
option the user only has to click. Telegram and Discord already pass
``interpret_commands=False`` on their callback paths; these pin the Slack parity.
