"""Section markers must survive the two transcript COPY paths: fork and transfer.

Both paths filtered to ``("user", "assistant")``, so a copied transcript kept
every turn but lost every section boundary -- the worst shape of the bug, because
the copy looks complete.

The invariant is two-sided: markers are PRESERVED (with their ``meta["label"]``,
not just the rendered divider), and the fork's INDEX SPACE does not move, so
``at_message_index`` still counts user/assistant turns only.

The transfer half also pins wire compatibility: markers ride in an additive
top-level ``section_markers`` field, not inside ``messages``, because the importer
validates message roles strictly and an older peer would reject the whole bundle.
