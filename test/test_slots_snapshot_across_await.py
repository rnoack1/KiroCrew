"""Build gate + tests: a slot-wide loop that awaits must iterate a SNAPSHOT.

``api_chat_folder_delete`` and ``api_chat_tag_delete`` walk every slot and
persist each one. Since the persist became ``await save_slot_off_loop(...)``,
each iteration contains a yield point — and ``state._slots`` is mutated by other
coroutines that can run during it (``session_transfer`` and ``session_control``
pop keys, ``openai_compat`` pops on its cleanup paths, ``get_or_create_slot``
assigns). Iterating the live ``.values()`` view across that yield raises
``RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration``.

That failure is worse than a 500. Both loops mutate before they persist, so the
raise lands with the work half-applied and the compensating path skipped: the
folder delete abandons the unfile partway and never reaches
``_restore_unfiled``, and the tag delete has already removed the tag row, so
some slots keep a tag id whose vocabulary entry is gone.

The fix is one word per site (``list(...)``), which is the form the slot-wide
loops in ``state.py`` already use. The gate is here because the defect is
invisible at the call site: nothing about ``for slot in state._slots.values()``
looks wrong until you notice the ``await`` nested inside it, and the next
slot-wide loop someone writes will read just as naturally.

    RE-POINTED TWICE, and the second time INVERTED -- read this before trusting the
    name. The first version relied on the default-filing branch assigning its
    caller's folder verbatim; that branch then began revalidating, so the test was
    re-pointed onto the one window the revalidation declined to judge: an arrival
    landing while the folder store lock was held, where ``folder_id_for_restore``
    failed open by way of a ``_folders_lock.locked()`` probe and ONLY a later sweep
    pass could clear the id.

    That window no longer exists. The validator reads ``_committed_folder_ids``,
    which the delete's own ``mutate_folders`` has already updated by the time any
    arrival lands, so the deleted id is pruned AT ASSIGNMENT and the lock is
    irrelevant. The premise control below therefore asserts the OPPOSITE of what it
    used to, and that inversion is the point: it is the observable consequence of
    retiring the probe.

    SO THIS TEST NO LONGER EXERCISES A REPEAT, and nothing here should be read as
    covering one. What it pins is the assignment-time prune, and that prune is what
    retired the repeat: this was the last arrival a second round still had to catch,
    so the sweep is now a SINGLE round. The two-pass split inside that round survives
    and is a different property -- pass one is yield-free so no fork can observe a
    half-swept set, pass two does all the awaiting -- asserted by the pass-one tests

    Measured while attempting exactly that fix, and recorded here so the next
    attempt does not repeat it. Two requirements collide on one field:

    * ANTI-CLOBBER wants a full save to CARRY an on-disk ``closed``, because the
      save rebuilds from an in-memory slot that may not know about a concurrent
      close. Dropping ``closed``/``closed_at`` from ``SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS`` gets
      this for free at every ``force=True`` site at once, via
      :func:`~kiro_crew.history.carry_unowned_metadata`.
    * ADOPT-REOPEN wants a full save to ERASE it. A session restored with
      ``adopt_closed=True`` is live in memory while ``closed=True`` is still on
      disk, and it is the next ordinary save's OMISSION that clears the flag so the
      session restores after the next restart. Live consumers:
      ``handlers/members.py`` and ``slack/gateway.py``.

    A full save cannot satisfy both, because it cannot tell "stale, does not know
    about the close" from "deliberately reopened" -- both present as a slot that
    reads open. So the real fix needs the save to be TOLD which it is (an explicit
    clear at the adopt sites, or a tri-state ``closed`` argument), which is a
    signature change plus a per-site intent audit -- not a key-set edit.

    Note also that persisting ``closed`` POSITIVELY does not close the window: the
    payload is rebuilt from a slot that reads open, so an explicit ``False``
    overwrites an on-disk ``True`` exactly as an absent key erases it. The encoding
    changes; the staleness does not.

#: Receiver names that denote a chat slot. ``job.folder_id`` (cron) and ``art.tags``

    WHY THIS IS A GATE RATHER THAN A CONVENTION. The delete handlers do not re-sweep
    the live view after their awaits, so nothing catches an id adopted mid-window on
    whoever's behalf. Validating at the producer is what allows that pass to be absent,
    so correctness rests on every adopter either routing through
    ``folder_id_for_restore``/``tag_ids_for_restore`` or being structurally unable to
    adopt a deleted id. Nothing about ``slot.folder_id = folder_id`` looks wrong at the
    call site, and the regression it reintroduces is silent: a durable dangling id that
    only surfaces as a phantom folder or tag after a restart.

    The four sibling gates cannot see this. One pins loop iteration, one pins the
    tag-snapshot write chain, one pins the folder publication choke point, one pins the
    force-save census; none notices a
    new assignment. So this converts the

    A RENAME IS NOT A VIOLATION, and the companion
    ``test_the_vocabulary_allowlist_has_no_stale_entries`` exists so a rename says so.
    The allowlist is keyed on the function NAME, so renaming an exempt function drops its
    exemption and this gate would then report the renamed function as an unvalidated
    adopter -- true in letter, but it names the wrong cause and sends the reader looking
