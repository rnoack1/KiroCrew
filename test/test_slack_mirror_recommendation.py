"""Slack has no badge, so a mirrored recommendation must be restated in the message.

The dashboard-only producer rule tells an agent to MARK a chip instead of naming its
pick in prose, and the dashboard renders that marker as a badge. Slack renders no badge
and the label is stripped before dispatch, so without a substitute a dashboard turn
mirrored into a linked Slack thread shows identical buttons under prose that never says
which one is recommended -- worse than before the marker existed, when the raw marker at
least appeared in the label.
