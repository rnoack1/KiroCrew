"""Tests for the auto-nudge egress scrub, its wire flags, and store vetting.

A nudge loop's text fields reach two very different places. The model receives
``message`` whole on every cycle -- that is the guarantee the nudge exists to
provide, and it is never rewritten. Everything a READER sees, though, is an
egress surface: the REST projection, the WS broadcast, and the transcript row are
persisted and served to every connected dashboard client.

So the scrub belongs at the SINKS, and this suite pins that:

1. **Every text field is scrubbed unless it is named.** A denylist, not an
   allowlist, so the next free-text field added to ``NudgeLoop`` is covered by
   the same loop rather than silently missed. The addressing fields are the
   deliberate exemption, because a rewritten ``id`` or ``slot_key`` would leave a
   row the client cannot act on.
2. **A scrubbed projection must never be written back as truth.** The wire
   carries ``message_redacted`` so a client can say the text is masked, and
   ``message_ignored`` when the backend declined a write, and the echo guard
   refuses a PATCH that merely returns the masked copy.
3. **A store it cannot vet is refused, not guessed at.** A row whose addressing
   field is credential-shaped is held aside rather than armed, and an unreadable
   sidecar refuses writes and is moved aside so recovery is a restart.

    carrying one arrives whole at the ``%s`` warning and splits one record into
    several in the log ring and the ``/api/logs`` stream. The forged tail is
    attacker-authored and indistinguishable from a real line, which makes the log
    unreliable exactly where it is used to diagnose a hand-edited store.

    The escape is supplied by ``repr`` -- ``redact(repr(value))``, the spelling
    ``cron.py`` uses for the identical malformed-entry warning and the base's own
    at ``session_storage.py``. That replaced a hand-rolled ``str.isprintable``

    (``unlink(missing_ok=True)``) and it sat BEFORE the 503 policy probe. So on a host
    whose credential policy cannot compose: the operator's live stop file for an
    ALREADY-RUNNING loop was deleted, and only then was the arm refused -- leaving the old
    unattended loop running with its stop signal gone. Deleting a control-plane file and

    ``authorize_and_update_nudge`` compares an incoming ``message`` against
    ``scrub_loop_text(current.message)`` and, on a match, sets it to ``None`` and answers
    200. So a client that read the loop, changed an unrelated field and PATCHed the whole
    object back was told the write succeeded while its ``message`` was discarded. The
    popover's dirty check stops OUR client doing it and a log line records it, but neither
    reaches a third-party client -- the API contract itself said nothing.

    The contract now says it on BOTH surfaces, because a GET-only flag is not enough:

    * **GET** carries ``message_redacted`` -- true when the served projection differs from
      the stored value, i.e. echoing it back WOULD be destructive. A client that reads
      before writing can now see that in advance.
    * **PATCH** carries ``message_ignored`` -- true when the guard kept the stored goal.
      A client that never GETs first learns nothing from the GET flag, so the response to
      the lossy write has to say so itself. Without this arm the finding is only half
      answered.

    ``test_a_clean_message_is_not_flagged`` is the negative control: a message with nothing
    credential-shaped in it round-trips unchanged, so the flag must be false and
    ``message_ignored`` absent. A flag hardcoded true, or one keyed on "did we scrub at all"

class TestTheTwoSkipArmsHoldNoRow:
    """GPT 5.6 (BLOCKING) + First Principles (Subtraction): the hold had to go.

    ``_load`` has TWO arms that decline a row, and they disagreed:

    * the malformed-entry ``except`` arm ``continue``s with no hold, so the row is
      dropped by the next wholesale write -- the contract ``cron.py`` documents
      ("dropped from the store on the next write");
    * the addressing-guard arm HELD the row and wrote it back, which then needed a
      retirement on slot close, a rollback for that retirement, and a rollback in
      ``_add_locked`` -- three hand-maintained paths for one invariant.

    The third path could not be completed. An aborted slot close rolls back through
    ``chat_handlers._restore_slot_nudge_loop(exc.loop, ...)`` where
    ``exc.loop = svc.get_by_slot(name)``, and ``get_by_slot`` searches ``_loops`` only --
    so for a refused row it is ``None`` and the caller has no token to restore. The
    retirement had already reached disk, so the row was permanently gone. That gap sits
    in a caller autonudge does not own, which is why no fourth rollback could close it.

    So the hold is gone, and NEITHER arm holds a row. This test pins that: it FAILS while
    one arm holds and the other drops, and passes once neither does.

    The arms are no longer identical at the WRITE, and deliberately so. A row declined by
    the addressing guard is QUARANTINED -- re-emitted under ``quarantined`` so the entry
    stays on disk to be repaired, because dropping it silently was a data-loss defect
    (GPT 5.6, BLOCKING). The malformed-entry arm still drops its row. What both share, and
    what this class covers, is that no row is HELD IN ``_loops``: with nothing in the live
    map there is no retirement, no retirement rollback, and nothing for an aborted close to
    restore. A quarantined row is invisible to ``get_by_slot``, so it cannot enter that path.

    """GPT 5.6 (BLOCKING): ``not isinstance(value, str)`` was an EARLY-OUT.

    ``_serialize``'s loop skipped any non-string value, so an agent-written
    ``message: ["AKIA..."]`` rode straight through to ``GET /api/autonudge`` and
    the ``autonudge_state`` WS broadcast. Measured before the fix: the loop LOADED
    and the serialized payload carried ``message = ['AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE']``.

    Two halves, because the right answer differs per field:

    * ADDRESSING fields (``id``/``slot_key``) are exempt from scrubbing BY DESIGN,
      so a non-string there rides both the exemption and the early-out -- and a
      list ``id`` is unhashable, so ``self._loops[loop.id] = loop`` raises
      uncaught, escapes ``_load`` and ``start()``, and NO loop arms at all. Those
      are REFUSED at load, like a credential-shaped one.
    * Other ``str``-declared fields are REDACT-COERCED at the sink. Blanking would
      destroy the operator's ability to see what is wrong; coercing scrubs the
      credential and keeps the value inspectable, and the field is declared ``str``
      so a string is what the contract already promises.

    ``idle_secs`` to ``"300"`` would break every client that compares it.
