/**
 * Screenshot harness + behavior check for the PACKAGE SKILL KEY QUALIFIER.
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA (website/dist) behind an in-process static server and
 * answers every /api/** call from fixtures via Playwright route interception. The
 * client code is unmodified — only the network is stubbed — so the Agent Templates
 * skill picker, its chips and the PATCH round-trip are exercised as they run in
 * production.
 *
 * What the qualifier changes that a user can SEE. Two package bundles vendoring a
 * skill at the same relative path used to collapse into ONE catalog row: the
 * second copy was unaddressable, which is the reported defect (skills missing from
 * the picker on an install with colliding bundles). Each colliding copy now gets
 * its own `package/<digest>:<rel>` key.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE SHOTS. Those keys are minted by
 * `enumerate_skill_catalog`, which feeds the tree, detail and agent-mapping
 * surfaces, and `GET /api/skills` -- what this picker reads -- re-keys a colliding
 * package row onto its qualified spelling, so such a copy DOES reach the picker
 * under its own key.
 * The catalog below is a stub; it is shaped for the surfaces that receive
 * qualified keys, which includes the mapped chip and the rejected-write path.
 *
 * Scene 2 covers the chip: a mapped qualified key renders its readable half plus
 * the first 8 hex, which is the surface that has to say WHICH copy is mapped.
 *
 * Scene 3 covers the other half: the editor now re-enumerates the catalog when a
 * write is REJECTED. A key carries its root's identity, so a bundle upgrade under a
 * live editor re-spells it and the backend refuses the whole request; the cached
 * catalog is then the stale one that minted the refused key, so without the
 * invalidation a retry re-sends exactly the key that was just rejected.
 *
 * This asserts as well as photographs and exits non-zero on a mismatch. Nothing in
 * CI runs this file — the CI-enforced half is AgentSkillsEditor.test.tsx and
 * test/test_resolve_skill_root_package.py.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-package-skill-key-qualifier.mjs [outDir]
