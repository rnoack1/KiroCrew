/**
 * Screenshots for the clear-context busy refusal on a channel.
 *
 * Drives the isolated capture entry (website/capture/clear-context-busy-refusal.html),
 * which mounts the REAL `Btn` and the REAL `ErrorNotice` the page renders, with the copy
 * resolved through the REAL `clearContextBusyMessage` exported from ChannelPage.
 *
 * The shipped refusal surface is the IN-PAGE banner, so each frame asserts the banner's
 * own text before writing: it must name every refusing role, the cause, and the retry.
 * A frame is not written unless those assertions hold, so an empty or mis-copied banner
 * fails the run rather than being committed as evidence. Dialogs are expected PER SCENE:
 * absent everywhere except the confirm scene, whose copy is read off the dialog event.
 *
 *   01-clear-all-two-roles-busy   partial clear-all, two of three roles mid-turn
 *   02-per-agent-role-busy        the per-agent control, its addressed role refusing
 *   03-clean-acknowledged         contrast: nothing refused, the clear is acknowledged
 *   07-confirm-dialog-copy        the native confirm bodies, read off the dialogs
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6841 --strictPort   # in another shell
 *   node scripts/capture-clear-context-busy-refusal.mjs http://127.0.0.1:6841 ../temp-screenshots/clear-context-busy-refusal
