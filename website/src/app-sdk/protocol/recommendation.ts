/**
 * `(recommended)` inside an option label is PROTOCOL, not label text.
 *
 * The dashboard's injected option-label rules instruct the agent to emit the
 * marker (`_OPTIONS_RECOMMENDED_RULE`, backend side), and only the dashboard
 * receives that rule. This grammar still RECOGNISES the marker rather than
 * requiring it: an unmarked label is valid and costs nothing.
 *
 * Recognising it matters because of where it lands. The label is dispatched verbatim
 * as the user's next message, so a marker left in it makes the user appear to be
 * recommending something to the assistant. It also renders as plain text inside
 * `ChipLabel`'s single clamped line, styled exactly like the instruction it sits
 * beside and competing with it for that line's width.
 *
 * Splitting it out lets the renderer place the marker OUTSIDE the clamped span,
 * where no label length can hide it, and keeps the chip one line tall.
 *
 * It also fixes what the click sends. The label doubles as the user's next
 * message, and "(recommended) Merge it now" is not a sentence the user wrote —
 * the recommendation was the agent's. Stripping it here means every surface
 * sends the instruction and only the instruction.
 */

/**
 * The marker, in the one form that has a producer: `(recommended)`.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, and this bounds UI copy rather than just parsing. Admitting
 * a marker is what paints a badge, so an open trailing word would let
 * `(recommended strongly)` style itself as a recommendation, and an open-ended
 * `\(([^)]*)\)` would do the same for any parenthetical in a label — "(see below)",
 * "(destructive)". The badge word itself is a constant in `ChipBadge`; this grammar
 * decides only WHETHER a label carries the marker.
 *
 * Ordering variants (`(recommended first)` / `(recommended then)`) are NOT
 * admitted: nothing in this repo emits them. Re-admit the day one is observed.
 *
 * A TRAILING marker is not admitted either, on the same standard: the producer rule
 * sanctions only the leading form, so no producer emits one. Admitting it would mean
 * removing text from a label on a guess, and a drifted trailing marker instead stays
 * visible as ordinary label text -- what happened before this grammar existed.
 *
 * LEADING ONLY, and this is a correctness boundary rather than a style choice. A
 * label is dispatched verbatim as the user's next message, so anything removed
 * from its interior is a word the user did not choose to drop: an unanchored
 * pattern turns `Search for the literal (recommended) token` into `Search for
 * the literal token`, silently changing what gets sent. The marker is a prefix on
 * the instruction; anything later is part of the instruction and is left alone.
 *
 * Not global: this is used with `exec`, and a `g` flag would carry `lastIndex`
 * between calls on a module-level regex and skip every other label.
