// Canonical marker regexes — the single source of truth for the frontend, mirroring the
// backend's ReDoS-hardened OPTIONS_RE_LINE / OPTION_ACTIONS_RE_LINE
// (src/kiro_crew/constants.py). Import these instead of hand-rolling a copy so the
// grammar can't drift between the dashboard's several parsers.
//
// TWO markers live here, deliberately siblings rather than one pattern with a mode flag:
// `[OPTION(S): a | b]` offers CONTENT choices that are sent as the next message, and
// `[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=label]` offers a LOCAL UI action that runs with no LLM turn.
// See OPTION_ACTION_MARKER_RE below for why the head is distinct rather than encoded in a
// label, and for the non-collision property that makes the split safe.
//
// The tempered body `(?:[^[\n]|\[(?!OPTIONS?:|OPTION-ACTIONS:))*` matches any run of
// characters that does NOT begin a fresh marker of EITHER kind, which gives three
// properties:
//   1. a label may itself contain `]` — the block ends at the LAST `]` that ends the
//      line, not the first `]` (so "[OPTIONS: a] | b]]" → ["a]", "b]"]);
//   2. two same-line markers can't merge into one garbage label — and because the
//      temper names BOTH heads, that holds for a MIXED same-line pair too
//      (`[OPTIONS: A] [OPTION-ACTIONS: close=B]`), not just two of a kind;
//   3. it fails in O(1) per `[OPTIONS:` prefix instead of rescanning the line, so
//      untrusted model output with thousands of `[OPTIONS:` prefixes can't drive
//      quadratic (ReDoS-class) backtracking in the synchronous render path.
// The marker must END ITS LINE (`\][ \t]*$` with the `m` flag) — a trailing note,
// question, or diff on later lines is left intact. `i` = case-insensitive OPTION(S);
// `g` = take the LAST marker / strip all. Group 1 = optional "S"; group 2 = labels.
//
// The optional `(?:\([^\s()]*\))?` after the `]` tolerates a stray markdown-link
// close that models sometimes append, e.g. `[OPTIONS: A | B](OPTIONS)`. Without it
// that suffix (a) breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed and (b) forms a
// valid `[label](url)` link, so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a purple
// link instead of buttons. The `(` must abut the `]` (no gap), so real trailing
// prose or a spaced `] (note)` still fails the anchor and is preserved. The group is
// OUTSIDE the label capture, so choices are unaffected — and because the regex is
// used with `replace`, the stray `(...)` is stripped from the displayed text too.
// The inner class is `[^\s()]` (not `[^)\n]`) so it shares no character with the
// trailing `[ \t]*` — that keeps the group unambiguous and ReDoS-safe (mirrors the
// backend OPTIONS_RE_LINE). The real tic contains no whitespace, so nothing is lost.
//
// The closing-bracket class (ASCII `]` plus the fullwidth / CJK lookalikes
// `】` U+3011, `］` U+FF3D, `〕` U+3015) mirrors the backend's `MARKER_CLOSERS`. The prompt only ever specifies ASCII `]`, but a
// model intermittently substitutes a lookalike, and a single wrong codepoint
// breaks the end anchor — the marker then leaks into the message as literal text
// and the turn silently loses its pills. Labels are unaffected, so accepting the
// lookalike costs nothing. ReDoS profile is unchanged from the previous literal
// `\]`: the class shares no character with the trailing `[ \t]*`, and the
// tempered body already admitted `]` via `[^[\n]`.
//
// `String#replace` is the only use that is safe on this shared const as-is: it resets `lastIndex`.
// `String#matchAll` does NOT — it seeds its internal clone from `lastIndex`, so pass a fresh
// `new RegExp(OPTION_MARKER_RE)` there. Never call `.exec`/`.test` on it: both leave the index
// advanced, and the next reader silently scans from the wrong offset. Both hazards apply
// verbatim to OPTION_ACTION_MARKER_RE below — they are properties of the `g` flag, not of
// which head the pattern carries.

/** Every protocol head a tempered body must refuse to cross, as ONE alternation shared
 *  by both patterns below. Longest-distinguishing first, mirroring the backend's
 *  `MARKER_PREFIXES` order. `OPTIONS?:` covers `[OPTIONS:` and the single-choice
 *  `[OPTION:`; `OPTION-ACTIONS:` is a genuinely separate literal rather than a case of
 *  it — the two strings diverge at `S` vs `-`, so `"[OPTION-ACTIONS:"` does not start
 *  with `"[OPTIONS:"` and a single-head temper does not cover it.
 *
 * The tempering exists for ReDoS (see the block above), but once a SECOND head exists it
 * also carries a correctness property the single-head version never needed: a body that
 * forbids only its OWN head still happily consumes the OTHER one. MEASURED on the
 * backend's `OPTIONS_RE_TRAILER` before its heads were shared — given
 * `"[OPTIONS: a | b]\n[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=X]"` its body crossed the second marker and
 * captured `" a | b]\n[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=X"`, so the action marker's raw text became
 * a BUTTON LABEL and the real second choice was lost. Silent: the regex matches, the
 * anchor is satisfied, and only the capture is wrong.
 *
 * Both frontend patterns are LINE forms whose bodies exclude `\n`, so only a SAME-LINE
 * pair (`[OPTIONS: A] [OPTION-ACTIONS: close=B]`) can reach it here — but that shape IS
 * reachable, and "which shapes are currently reachable" is a property of today's call
 * sites rather than of the grammar. Both heads are therefore excluded from both bodies.
 *
 * Adding a head stays linear: at each position either the character is not `[` (first
 * alternative) or it is and the lookahead alone decides — the alternatives remain
 * mutually exclusive, so no new backtracking path appears. */
// Every fragment below is a REGEX LITERAL read through `.source`, never a quoted
// string. Two reasons, and the second is why it is worth the `.source` noise: the
// engine parses each fragment at author time, so a malformed class or an unbalanced
// group is a syntax error here rather than a runtime throw from `new RegExp`; and a
// literal needs one level of backslash instead of two, which is what keeps
// `[^[\n]` and `\u3011` readable. The i18n string-literal gate also reads a quoted
// grammar fragment as user-facing copy, which it is not.

 * last head and the last closer, so `b` was accepted and rendered a chip with the outer
 * head still open.
 *
 * Depth counts HEAD brackets only, and a closer pops whichever bracket is innermost. A
 * bare count was wrong the same way one step down: a citation `[1]` inside an open head
 * supplied a closer that cancelled the head, so
 * `[OPTIONS: see [1] for details [OPTION-ACTIONS: close=X]` rendered a live close chip
 * from syntax matching no content marker, while the same line without the citation

 * window (one to a few hundred deltas, i.e. the width of the marker line) where
 * the raw `[OPTIONS: Merge it now | Show me the d…` — or
 * `[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=Nothi…` — types itself out as prose and then vanishes
 * into pills or a chip at turn end. This suppresses the growing tail so the
 * marker is never visible in either form. The action marker needs this at least
 * as much: it renders as a single chip, so the raw text is a larger fraction of
 * what the user briefly sees.
 *
 * An unterminated marker is by construction at the tail of the buffer, so only
 * the last line — clipped to TAIL_SCAN — is examined. The window is sliced FIRST
 * and the line break located inside it, so the probe cost is bounded by
 * TAIL_SCAN rather than by the buffer: a newline-free multi-megabyte stream would
 * otherwise make the `\n` search alone scan the whole buffer on every frame. Plain
 * indexOf on the bounded slice, not a regex scan of the content — linear, no
 * backtracking, no ReDoS surface added to the synchronous render path.
 *
 * Two shapes are recognized:
 *   1. a complete head whose marker is still being WRITTEN → cut at the head.
 *      "Still being written" is not "no closing bracket yet": a label may
 *      legitimately contain one, so the test is whether the label list continues
 *      after the last closer (see CONTINUES_LABELS_RE). A head whose marker
 *      closed and was followed by ordinary same-line prose is left alone — that
 *      prose is real content, and OPTION_MARKER_RE deliberately declines to
 *      parse that shape as a marker.
 *   2. mid-head, i.e. the tail is still a prefix of a head (`[`, `[OPT`,
 *      `[OPTIONS`, `[OPTION-ACT`) → cut at the `[`. Because a half-typed head is
 *      ambiguous with ordinary prose, this branch is doubly constrained: the `[`
 *      must open a line or follow whitespace (so `arr[0` is never touched), and
 *      the prefix casing must be consistent (see PARTIAL_HEAD_UPPER_RE).
 *
 * Cutting is safe in case 1 because `parseOptions` runs FIRST — and it strips
 * markers of BOTH kinds — so a head reaching this function belongs to a marker that
 * is not yet complete-and-line-final.
 *
 * A SAME-LINE PAIR used to be the exception: the tail required `$`, so the earlier of
 * two markers on one line could not match, `[OPTIONS: A] [OPTIONS: B]` (or a mixed
 * pair) kept only the last, and the first arrived here complete. The tail now also
 * terminates before a sibling marker, so `parseOptions` consumes BOTH and nothing
 * complete reaches this function from that shape — which is why this paragraph
 * records history rather than a live caveat.
 *
 * The residual limit, stated so it is not mistaken for an oversight: a label that
 * contains a closer AND continues with words rather than a separator
 * (`[OPTIONS: Fix ] logging | Skip`) is visible between that closer and the next
 * separator. Both alternatives are worse — keying on "a closer arrived" releases
 * the whole marker, and cutting unconditionally swallows a genuine sentence.
 *
 * Call this ONLY while a message is streaming. On a finished message an
 * unterminated marker is real content — prose that happens to discuss the
 * syntax, or a truncated turn — and must render as written.
