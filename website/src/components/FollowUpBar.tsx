 * A chip whose click runs a LOCAL UI action instead of composing or sending text.

 * Deliberately a SEPARATE component from `Chip` rather than a flag threaded through
 * it. `Chip` has THREE routes out to the text path — the undebounced `onSelect`, the
 * debounced `onSelect` plus its `onDoubleClick` → `onSend`, and the `▲` split segment
 * → `onSend` — and the plan-action precedent shows what a partial interception costs:
 * intercepting only the single click leaves a double-click and the `▲` segment sending
 * the label as chat text. A flag would have to be honoured at all three, and a fourth
 * route added later would leak by default. This component closes over neither
 * `onSelect` nor `onSend`, so it CANNOT reach them — the property is structural rather
 * than maintained.
 *
 * Consequently: exactly one `onClick`, no `onDoubleClick`, no debounce timer, and no
 * send segment. There is nothing for a debounce to protect against here (no
 * double-click gesture to cancel), and dispatching synchronously means the
 * `sourceKey` handed to `onAction` is genuinely the one on screen at click time.
 *
 * Blocked while the composer holds anything unsent — a content pick, typed text, or a
 * staged attachment. All three live only in the composer, and an action tears the
 * composer down (the shipped action is `close`), so dispatching would silently discard
 * work the user had assembled. Blocking it is recoverable — clear it and click again —
 * where the discard is not. Picks were the original gate; they turned out to be one
 * route to a non-empty composer rather than the only one.
