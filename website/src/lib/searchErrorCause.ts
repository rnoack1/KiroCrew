/**
 * Name WHY a file-search or listing request failed, as a cause the caller maps to
 * its own copy.
 *
 * Hoisted rather than spelled per surface: the @-menu and the folder panel classify
 * the SAME endpoint's refusals, so a divergence here would name one failure two
 * different things depending on which surface the user happened to be in.
 *
 * Keyed on the machine-readable `code`, never the human `error` string, which is
 * untranslated server text. An unrecognised cause degrades to `failed` rather than
 * leaking the raw reason, and a 403 carrying `authRequired` is a dashboard-session
 * expiry rather than a refusal of this path, so it must not claim the folder is off
 * limits.
