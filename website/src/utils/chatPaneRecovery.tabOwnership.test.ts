/** GPT 5.6 F2 at 9a26ecb74: two tabs on one slot share the recovery store, and the slot-wide
 *  newest-by-gen reader had no ownership identity — so a sibling tab adopted the other's parked
 *  send and its own settlement then retired it, losing the prompt unrecoverably.
 *
 *  A new TAB is modelled the way the browser makes one: sessionStorage is per browsing context so it
 *  starts empty, while localStorage (the record store) is shared. A RELOAD is the same tab, so its
 *  sessionStorage survives — that case must still recover, which is what makes the in-memory
 *  `TAB_ID` unusable as the owner here.
