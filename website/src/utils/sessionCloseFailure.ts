/** Which of the two close failures this rejection is — CLASSIFICATION ONLY.
 *
 *  Both close gestures route here — the session menu and Alt+Shift+W — because a
 *  terminal failure restores the row, and a row reappearing alone looks like the
 *  flicker `closingSlots` fixes.
 *
 *  Only TWO outcomes are distinguishable, and the split is about what the user may
 *  safely do next. A definitive client-side refusal is the server's considered
 *  answer, so the session is provably still there. Anything else — no status at
 *  all, a timeout, a rate limit, a 5xx from something in the path — leaves the
 *  outcome UNKNOWN: the DELETE may have completed, and slot keys are reusable, so
 *  a second close could reach whatever now holds the key.
 *
 *  This module renders nothing and resolves no copy. It used to call `alert()`,
 *  which the repo's `errors-use-error-notice` rule bans; the rule's glob covers
 *  `.tsx` only, so a `.ts` helper escaped it by scope rather than by being right.
 *  The App shell now renders the outcome through `ErrorNotice`. */
