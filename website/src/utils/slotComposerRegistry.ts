/**
 * Which mounted composers hold unsent work for a given slot?
 *
 * The close option action tears a slot down, and its gate used to read ONE
 * composer: the host that owned the click. That is a different question from "is
 * it safe to close this slot", because a slot can be displayed by more than one
 * mounted host and each keeps its draft in its OWN `useState` — so a draft typed
 * in pane B is invisible to the gate running in pane A, and the delete strands it.
 *
 * Nothing in the pane tree forbids that: `useSessionGrid.fillLeaf` applies a slot
 * with no duplicate check, and only a `.filter()` over `occupiedSlots` in the
 * placeholder picker's render keeps one slot out of two panes. A UI-side filter is
 * not an invariant, so the gate must not depend on it.
