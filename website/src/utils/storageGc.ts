/**
 * Remove localStorage keys whose owning session instance has provably been REPLACED.
 * Call once on app boot after fetching the slot list.
 *
 * ABSENCE FROM A LIST IS NEVER EVIDENCE, AND NEITHER IS AGE.
 * `localStorage` is shared by every tab on the origin while the list is one tab's
 * snapshot, and SESSION KEYS ARE REUSED. So an aged orphan is not a dead one: a key
 * legitimately idle past any grace can be resumed under the SAME id by another tab
 * after this boot's snapshot serialized, and deleting it then destroys that tab's live
 * UI state. Age proves only that the id WAS unlisted, which is the wrong proposition.
 *
 * The evidence used instead is SUPERSESSION, and it is the WRITER's stamp that supplies
 * it: `recordSessionStorageOwner` records which instance wrote the state, so a key is
 * deleted only when the live list presents its id as a DIFFERENT instance than the one
 * that wrote it. This sweep never stamps the ledger itself -- doing so would date state
 * it did not write and would delete a live reused session's keys.
 *
 * Returns the number of keys removed.
