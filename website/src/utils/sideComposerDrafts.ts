/**
 * Per-COMPOSER draft persistence for the SIDE and EMBEDDED composers.
 *
 * One key per composer, not one blob holding every slot. A shared blob makes each write a
 * read-modify-write over entries this window does not own, so a popout persisting a DIFFERENT
 * slot between the read and the write is erased — and the close guard then reads that slot
 * clean and deletes it with the draft unsent. `slotDraftStore` states the limitation in its
 * own header: it overwrites the whole key, is last-write-wins across tabs, and accepts that
 * "because the dashboard is effectively single-tab". Cross-window guarding is precisely what
 * stops that being true, so this store cannot inherit the assumption.
 *
 * The generic store's other policies came with the shared view: `maxEntries` and
 * `maxStoreBytes` order evictions across slots, which no per-key layout can see. Its TTL
 * carries over unchanged, and pruning on read reclaims what a crashed window left behind.
