 * wire contract. Status is checked too so a hypothetical non-409 reuse of the
 * code word elsewhere cannot trip the busy copy.
 *
 * The shape check is STRUCTURAL (`status` + `body`, the fields `ApiError`
 * carries) rather than `instanceof ApiError`, deliberately: the switch
 * surfaces' tests replace the `../api/client` module wholesale, and an
 * `instanceof` against a class the mock does not export throws inside the
 * failure handler — turning every switch failure into an unhandled error.

 * switch was refused and that retrying after the turn ends will work. Mapping
 * it here (the one chokepoint every switch surface routes failures through)
 * keeps the dropdown, all four cycle handlers, and future callers in step.
 *
 * Otherwise prefers the message the API layer already produced, because it is
 * the only part of the failure that carries anything specific — the endpoint
 * answers a bad agent name and a missing slot differently, and both are more
 * useful than a generic string. Falls back to the shared unexpected-error copy
 * when the rejection carries no usable message, so a non-Error throw still
