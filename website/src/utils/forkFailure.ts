 * The over-capacity refusal reaches three entry points -- the transcript's own fork
 * button, the session grid's, and "Duplicate" in the session list -- and a whole-session
 * fork has no chosen message, so all three advise the recovery the backend names: fork AT
 * a message instead. Keyed on the machine-readable code, never on the prose, and reusing
 * the transcript path's own strings so the three cannot drift into three answers.
 *
 * `direction` mirrors what the transcript path resolves from `tail_fork_enabled`: a head
 * deployment copies the slice UP TO the chosen message, a tail one copies FROM it onwards,
 * so the smaller slice lies at opposite ends and the advice inverts with it.
