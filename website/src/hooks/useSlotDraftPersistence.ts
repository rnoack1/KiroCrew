/**
 * Persist a side/embedded composer's draft against its slot.
 *
 * The close guard's cross-window claim expires, so an in-memory draft in a window that
 * froze in the background became invisible and a close elsewhere destroyed it. Writing
 * the text to storage is what makes expiry safe: the guard's persisted fallback never
 * ages out, so the draft stays discoverable after the claim is gone.
 *
 * Flushes on the debounce alone. An UNMOUNT deliberately CLEARS ITS OWN entry instead: the
 * panel being dismissed takes its draft with it, so a persisted copy would block that slot's
 * close for the store's whole TTL while nothing on screen held the draft it named.
 *
 * That still closes the hole this exists for, because the case it guards is a window that
 * FREEZES — which never unmounts. Its debounced write has already landed, so the draft stays
 * discoverable after the cross-window claim ages out. A window that crashes outright runs no
 * cleanup either, so its copy survives too.
 *
 * Returns whether the CURRENT text is already durable. Until the debounce fires there is no
 * copy for another window to find, so a claim published as recoverable in that window would
 * lean on a fallback that does not exist yet — which is what the caller tiers its claim on.
