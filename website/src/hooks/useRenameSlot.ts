/**
 * The single rename commit path, shared by the sidebar row editor and the ChatPage
 * header editor.
 *
 * ONE commit per slot at a time. A rename is a PATCH of one field, so two of them
 * racing on the wire let the server apply the older one last, and no client
 * bookkeeping can reorder what already arrived — so the second is refused while
 * the first is in flight. That removes the ordering problem at the source, which
 * is why there are no sequence numbers and no per-rename ack cache here.
 *
 * What serialization does NOT answer is whether the server spoke at all while the
 * one request was open: a pushed title event can carry the very string that was
 * typed, so comparing values cannot tell an independent confirmation from this
 * client's own guess. The generation counters answer that, and only that.
 *
 * The in-flight set is MODULE-level, not `useRef`: a slot can be renamed from
 * either surface, and per-component state would let each start one.
