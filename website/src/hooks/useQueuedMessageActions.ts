/**

 *
 * Issue #5891: the four callbacks were copy-mirrored across those hosts, and the
 * copies had drifted — cancel restored the composer in `ChatPage` only, so
 * cancelling from a split pane silently destroyed the draft, and neither host
 * threaded the `pendingIds` latch `QueueStack` has always accepted. Both are
 * behaviours per surface, which is exactly why they must not live in the hosts:
 * fixing one fork does not fix the other, and #2240 was that failure mode.
 *
 * NOT a home for `SideChat`'s queue. That surface talks to a different endpoint
 * family (`/side/queue/…`), stores its cards as `SideQueueEntry[]` under
 * `slotSide[slot]` rather than as `role: 'queued'` transcript rows, and is
 * deliberately SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE where this one is optimistic — the inverse
 * contract, for a documented reason. See that file, and the PR for #5891.
 *
 * Cancel and edit stay optimistic and still swallow a failed mutation, matching
 * what both hosts did before this hook existed. Item 1 of #5891 — rollback or
 * dispatch-after-success, plus an error surface — is a contract change with two
 * viable answers, and lands here, once, when someone picks one.
