/**
 * The `[OPTION-ACTIONS:]` close dispatch — ONE copy, shared by every host.
 *
 * ## Why this is a hook and not two hand-mirrored copies
 *
 * It was duplicated across `ChatPage` and `ChatPane`, ~130 lines each, and the
 * comments admitted it ("mirrors ChatPage's dispatch"). Two independent review
 * lanes named the duplication, and it had ALREADY DIVERGED: the settle-time
 * composer recheck was called with 2 arguments in one host and 5 in the other, so
 * one host closed over staged work the other refused to. That is precisely the
 * failure class this dispatch exists to prevent — a tab torn down with unsent work
 * in it, or a breadcrumb lost — reintroduced by the copy rather than by the logic.
 *
 * Shaped after `usePlanActionMutation`, the repo's existing mechanism for
 * host-shared chip dispatch, rather than inventing a second pattern.
 *
 * ## The state machine, in order, and why each step is where it is
 *
 * 1. **Enum guard.** Only `close` acts. A future member must opt IN rather than
 *    fall through to a tab teardown.
 * 2. **Staleness, first check.** A click can outlive the row it was made on:
 *    content chips are debounced and a byte-identical replacement row re-renders
 *    without remounting. Already stale on arrival → write NOTHING, because a
 *    breadcrumb would record a decision against a row the user had left.
 * 3. **Slot resolution**, read fresh (not captured), because the closure's slot can
 *    be one the user has already navigated away from under lag.
 * 4. **CONFIRM.** Before the write, and this ordering is a fix: the breadcrumb is a
 *    permanent `inject` row, so writing it first left the transcript asserting a
 *    close the user then cancelled — a durable record of something that never
 *    happened.
 * 5. **Breadcrumb write.** Inside the close's own pre-delete window, so the
 *    `appended === true` gate below still governs whether the delete proceeds.
 * 6. **Append gate.** MEASURED: a note answering `appended: false` is held in
 *    memory and is NOT durably recorded at the moment this decision is made, and
 *    the close answers 200 either way, so there is no error to catch. `close_slot`
 *    DOES now flush held notes — this PR adds that — so a close no longer destroys
 *    one; the gate stands because a note the backend has not committed is still not
 *    the record the action exists to leave. Server-side counterpart:
 *    the `TestDeferredNoteLostOnClose` suite.
 * 7. **Staleness, second check.** The write is a round trip; a slow one lands after
 *    the user has started another turn, by which point the derived key has moved (a
 *    `user` row ends the scan). Closing then would dismiss the tab AND cancel that
 *    turn. The breadcrumb is KEPT — it landed, and it honestly records the pick.
 * 8. **Composer recheck.** The chip is disabled while the composer holds work, but
 *    that gate is evaluated when the row PAINTS. This handler awaits a network
 *    write, and work staged inside that window passes every check above — the
 *    source key cannot catch it, because typing appends no transcript row.
