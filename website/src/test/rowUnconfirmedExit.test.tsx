/** An unconfirmed row must stay removable after the composer strip is gone.
 *
 *  Editing past containment retires the strip while the row's `deliveryUnknown` deliberately stays --
 *  an edit is no receipt, so un-dimming would make the transcript vouch for an unproven delivery. But
 *  `dropUnconfirmedRow` was reachable only from a strip exit, so once the strip went the bubble was
 *  permanent: dimmed, captioned, and with no action beside it.
 *
 *  The exit is a HOST-SUPPLIED callback, not a store read: this row is also drawn by the app-sdk
 *  renderers and the IME suites with no Provider around it, so touching the store here breaks them.
