/** Apply an authoritative slot list, reusing the object identity of every row

 *
 *  Membership AND order come from `next` — the server is authoritative on both.
 *  Only per-row identity is carried across, and only for a structurally equal
 *  row, so no consumer can read stale content off a reused reference. The
 *  comparison uses the shared `jsonEqual`, whose key-order independence and
 *  field-agnosticism this relies on: a row may have been patched in place by
 *  `touchSlotActivity` / `updateSlot` / `patchSlotLink` since it was stored (so
 *  its key order can differ from the payload's), and a comparator that listed
 *  `ChatSlot`'s fields would stop seeing a newly added one and pin a stale row
 *  on screen — a correctness bug, where an extra re-render is only a cost.
 *
 *  Identity is load-bearing here rather than a micro-optimisation. The sidebar
 *  renders every row as a Framer `motion.div` with `layout="position"` inside one
 *  `LayoutGroup`, and every selector over `dashboard.slots` invalidates when the

 *  re-renders and re-measures the entire list — which reads as the sidebar
 *  reloading rather than as one session becoming active. Slot pushes coalesce at
 *  200ms server-side, so a single active turn delivers several full lists per
 *  second and the effect is continuous.
 *
 *  Skipping the assignment (rather than assigning an equal array) is the half
 *  that matters most: it leaves the array reference alone, which lets a
 *  downstream `useMemo` skip its filter and sort entirely instead of recomputing

 *  snapshot is never stale, so a frame from an older gateway still applies. */
/** True when a snapshot was serialized BEFORE the newest one already applied.
 *
 *  Keyed on the PAIR `(epoch, generation)`. The generation orders snapshots within one
 *  gateway process; the epoch says which process counted them. A restart resumes the
 *  counter at 0 while a still-loaded tab keeps its high value, so a generation-only
 *  comparison would reject every snapshot the new process sent — on both transports, with
 *  no recovery until the counter climbed past the retained value or the page reloaded.
 *  A differing epoch therefore means "not comparable", which is not the same as stale.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT a reset on `sseConnected`: clearing the baseline at reconnect time
 *  would reopen the in-window race the stamp exists to close, because a pre-pop frame can
 *  still arrive after the reconnect. An UNSTAMPED snapshot is never stale, so a frame from
 *  an older gateway still applies.
 *
 *  Takes the fields it reads rather than a whole slice state, so the dispatch boundary can
 *  apply the identical rule before either reducer sees the action. There is ONE baseline —
 *  this slice's — and one copy of this rule; `chatSlice` consumes the verdict rather than
 *  keeping a second baseline, which would have to be kept in step with the retired set too.
 *
 *  RETIRED epochs are the exception to "not comparable". Once a snapshot from a DIFFERENT
 *  epoch has been accepted, the previous epoch is a process this client has moved past, so a
 *  reply still in flight from it is not merely incomparable — applying it restores membership
 *  that is already gone (GPT #6807 F1). An epoch never seen before is still accepted, which
 *  is what keeps the restarted-gateway recovery path intact.
 *
 *  `issuedEpoch` closes the ordering hole that acceptance leaves open. Retiring in order
 *  only covers epochs this client actually ADOPTED, so an intermediate epoch B that was
 *  never adopted — its reply overtaken by a C snapshot — is neither retired nor equal to
 *  the live epoch, and accepting it would retire the LIVE epoch C and freeze membership
 *  until a reload. So a read carries the epoch that was live when it was ISSUED: if the
 *  live epoch has moved on since, a reply from a third epoch is arriving late and is
 *  refused. Deliberately NOT "any differing epoch is stale", which would reintroduce the
 *  no-recovery-until-reload defect acceptance was written to avoid — while the live epoch
 *  still matches the one the read was issued under, a new epoch is a genuine restart and
 *  is adopted as before. A caller with no issue record (a pushed frame, which no client
 *  request dates) passes nothing and keeps the previous behaviour. */
