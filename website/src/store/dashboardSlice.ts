/** One in-flight close, stamped with the close GENERATION it opened.

 *  guesses at it. Nothing on the wire distinguishes slot instances, but every read
 *  the client issues can be dated against the closes it has performed.
 *
 *  This type, `closeSeq`, `pendingSlotReads` and `retireReadId` below reconstruct an
 *  ordering the wire now carries itself, as `slotsGeneration` paired with `slotsEpoch` —
 *  but only the SERVER-versus-SERVER half of it, so they are NOT simply redundant. Two
 *  cases sit outside the stamp's authority and must not be deleted on it:
 *
 *  - The LOCAL OPTIMISTIC CREATE. `addSlotOptimistic` bumps `closeSeq` for a purely local
 *    insertion, and no server-drawn number can date that race, because at the moment of
 *    the bump the row exists in no server snapshot for a number to be newer or older than.
 *  - The tombstone hold in `closingSlots`. The stamp refuses an OUT-OF-ORDER snapshot; it
 *    cannot refuse a push coalesced MID-CLOSE, which is genuinely the newest emission and
 *    truthfully still lists the slot the DELETE has not yet removed. `sseSlots` applies
 *    such a push without sweeping, so the withhold is what suppresses the flicker this
 *    module exists to fix.
 *
 *  The session-control module spec records the same scope, and is the fuller statement. */

 *
 *  A push withholds but never retires: it carries no id, and a coalesced frame can
 *  be serialized before the pop, so it proves nothing about ordering.
 *
 *  MATCHING THE ID IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. A close whose
 *  DELETE response was LOST still has its bound read issued after the request but
 *  possibly BEFORE `close_slot` finished, so that reply can arrive STILL LISTING the
 *  key -- not because the close failed, but because it has not finished. Retiring
 *  there restores the row, a new turn can start on it, and the close then pops the
 *  slot and cancels that turn. So retirement needs the id AND the reply's own
 *  OMISSION of the key: absence from an accepted list is what proves the pop. A reply
 *  that still lists it proves nothing, so the tombstone stays and `reconcileSlots`
 *  keeps reading. An explicit refusal releases by its own path (`slotCloseSettled`),

 *  row, so no consumer can read stale content off a reused reference. The
 *  comparison uses the shared `jsonEqual`, whose key-order independence and

 *
 *  Identity is load-bearing here rather than a micro-optimisation. The sidebar

 *  `LayoutGroup`, and every selector over `dashboard.slots` invalidates when the

 *  hands every row a new reference on every frame, so one slot's status change
 *  re-renders and re-measures the entire list — which reads as the sidebar
 *  reloading rather than as one session becoming active. Slot pushes coalesce at
 *  200ms server-side, so a single active turn delivers several full lists per
 *  second and the effect is continuous.
 *
 *  Skipping the assignment (rather than assigning an equal array) is the half

 *  downstream `useMemo` skip its filter and sort entirely instead of recomputing

/** True when a snapshot was serialized BEFORE the newest one already applied.

 *  from it is the resurrection this refuses. Equal counts as stale — one emission gets
 *  one stamp, so a repeat is a redelivery with nothing new to apply. An UNSTAMPED
 *  snapshot is never stale, so a frame from an older gateway still applies. */
/** True when a snapshot was serialized BEFORE the newest one already applied.
 *
 *  Keyed on the PAIR `(epoch, generation)`. The generation orders snapshots within one
 *  gateway process; the epoch says which process counted them. A restart resumes the
 *  counter at 0 while a still-loaded tab keeps its high value, so a generation-only
 *  comparison would reject every snapshot the new process sent — on both transports, with
 *  no recovery until the counter climbed past the retained value or the page reloaded.
 *  A differing epoch therefore means "not comparable", which is not the same as stale.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT a reset on `sseConnected`: clearing the baseline at reconnect time
 *  would reopen the in-window race the stamp exists to close, because a pre-pop frame can
 *  still arrive after the reconnect. An UNSTAMPED snapshot is never stale, so a frame from
 *  an older gateway still applies.
 *
 *  Takes the fields it reads rather than a whole slice state, so the dispatch boundary can
 *  apply the identical rule before either reducer sees the action. There is ONE baseline —
 *  this slice's — and one copy of this rule; `chatSlice` consumes the verdict rather than
 *  keeping a second baseline, which would have to be kept in step with the retired set too.
 *
 *  RETIRED epochs are the exception to "not comparable". Once a snapshot from a DIFFERENT
 *  epoch has been accepted, the previous epoch is a process this client has moved past, so a
 *  reply still in flight from it is not merely incomparable — applying it restores membership
 *  that is already gone. An epoch never seen before is still accepted, which
 *  is what keeps the restarted-gateway recovery path intact.
 *
 *  `issuedEpoch` closes the ordering hole that acceptance leaves open. Retiring in order
 *  only covers epochs this client actually ADOPTED, so an intermediate epoch B that was
 *  never adopted — its reply overtaken by a C snapshot — is neither retired nor equal to
 *  the live epoch, and accepting it would retire the LIVE epoch C and freeze membership
 *  until a reload. So a read carries the epoch that was live when it was ISSUED: if the
 *  live epoch has moved on since, a reply from a third epoch is arriving late and is
 *  refused. Deliberately NOT "any differing epoch is stale", which would reintroduce the
 *  no-recovery-until-reload defect acceptance was written to avoid — while the live epoch
 *  still matches the one the read was issued under, a new epoch is a genuine restart and
 *  is adopted as before. A caller with no issue record (a pushed frame, which no client
 *  request dates) passes nothing and keeps the previous behaviour. */
