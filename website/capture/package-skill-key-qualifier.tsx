/**
 * Capture entry for the PACKAGE SKILL KEY QUALIFIER's user-visible surfaces.
 *
 * Renders AgentSkillsEditor ALONE, as the other capture entries do — and here that is also what
 * makes the shots possible: the full SPA pulls a dependency this sandbox cannot install, while an
 * isolated entry never imports it. `api` is stubbed by mutating the imported module object, so a
 * scene does not depend on which URL or envelope the client uses.
 *
 * Scenes, each an evidence gap the UX lane named: `twins` — two bundles vendoring one relative
 * path, each mapped under its own qualified key with the "Located in …" line saying which copy is
 * bound (unqualified, these collapse into one row and the second is unaddressable); `unmanaged` —
 * hand-authored URIs, their config glyph and the ✕; `warn` — a mapped key whose installed copy is
 * gone, showing the warn chip and the count line.
