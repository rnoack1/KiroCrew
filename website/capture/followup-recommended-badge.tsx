/**
 * Isolated capture + measurement entry for the `(recommended)` badge.
 *
 * WHY ISOLATED: the defect IS layout. Whether the marker survives depends on
 * where Chromium puts the ellipsis, which depends on the font, the chip's real
 * box and the container width — happy-dom computes none of it, so the unit suite
 * (src/test/FollowUpBar.test.tsx) can only pin the DOM contract: badge outside
 * the truncating span. That contract is necessary and not sufficient. A badge
 * rendered outside the span but pushed past the chip's right edge would satisfy
 * every class assertion and still be invisible.
 *
 * So the measurement here is the user-visible question and nothing softer: is
 * the marker inside the painted box? `__measure()` answers it by taking a Range
 * over the marker's own characters (before arm) or the badge element (after arm)
 * and comparing its rect against the chip's content edge.
 *
 * `fix=off` renders exactly what upstream renders — marker left inside the label,
 * no `recommended` prop — so the before arm is a faithful reproduction rather
 * than a differently-broken page, and the defect is asserted rather than assumed.
 *
 * Query string: ?width=compact&theme=dark&fix=on
