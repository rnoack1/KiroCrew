# ── Canonical "[OPTIONS: a | b | c]" trailer parsers ────────────────────────
# The agent emits a trailing ``[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | ...]`` marker that
# every surface renders as tappable choices. Two variants exist because the
# surfaces scan differently, but their GRAMMAR must stay identical — so both are
# defined here ONCE and imported everywhere: a hand-mirrored copy risks a
# one-character slip that flips the flag semantics or reintroduces the ReDoS
# class below on a single surface.
#
# Body: a TEMPERED greedy repetition that allows every bracket EXCEPT a ``[``
# that begins a fresh ``[OPTIONS:``. This matters for ReDoS (py/polynomial-redos):
# a plain greedy ``.*`` body can itself consume a ``[`` that also starts the outer
# ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so over untrusted text with many ``[OPTIONS:`` prefixes
# ``search()``/``findall()`` re-explore the body from each position — polynomial
# backtracking. The tempered body is unambiguous (linear) while still capturing a
# literal ``]`` and any other inner ``[`` inside an option ("Fix [x] logging",
# "a[1]"). This parser runs over untrusted LLM/relayed text before Slack, the
# dashboard, Discord, Telegram, and WeCom render it.
#
# LINE (``re.MULTILINE``, ``$`` anchor) — for Slack/dashboard, where the marker
# ends a LINE (not necessarily the whole message). The negated class EXCLUDES
# ``\n`` (``[^[\n]``): in Python ``re`` a negated class matches ``\n`` regardless
# of DOTALL, so ``[^[]`` here would silently widen the single-line body to span
# lines (deleting/splitting a multi-line span the old single-line ``.*`` never
# matched). Trailing class is ``[ \t]`` (NOT ``\s``, which under MULTILINE would
# also match ``\n``).
#
# OPTIONAL MARKDOWN-LINK CLOSE ``(?:\(...\))?`` after the ``]``: models sometimes
# append a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` (or any ``(...)``) right after the marker, e.g.
# ``[OPTIONS: A | B | C](OPTIONS)``. That does TWO bad things at once: the extra
# text after ``]`` breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed, AND
# ``[label](url)`` is valid Markdown so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a
# clickable link instead of buttons. Absorbing a single tightly-attached ``(...)``
# here (it stays OUTSIDE the captured label group, so choices are unaffected)
# makes the parser resilient to that tic. The ``(`` must follow the ``]`` with no
# gap, so genuine trailing prose (``] and then...``) or a spaced note (``] (note)``)
# still fails the anchor and is left intact — the deliberate "trailing note on the
# same line" behaviour is preserved. The inner class is ``[^\s()]`` (NOT ``[^)\n]``)
# so it shares NO character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` — that keeps the added group
# unambiguous and avoids a polynomial-ReDoS (``py/polynomial-redos``) backtracking
# path over ``[OPTIONS:`` + a long whitespace run. The real tic (``(OPTIONS)``, a
# bare ``(url)``) contains no whitespace or nested parens, so nothing is lost.
#: Closing brackets accepted on a protocol marker. ASCII ``]`` is the only form
#: the prompt ever specifies, but a model intermittently substitutes a fullwidth
#: or CJK lookalike — U+3011 ``】`` is the observed one; U+FF3D ``］`` and U+3015
#: ``〕`` are the same class of slip. A single wrong codepoint otherwise breaks
#: the end anchor, so the whole marker leaks into the visible message as literal
#: text and the turn silently loses its follow-up pills. Label content is
#: unaffected either way, so accepting the lookalike costs nothing.
#:
#: ONE definition, shared by both regexes below. Deliberately NOT used by
#: :func:`split_trailing_protocol_suffix`'s unfinished-marker check, which stays
#: ASCII-only on purpose -- see the comment there. That asymmetry is the point:
#: completeness is decided by the trailer regex, not by whether some closer
#: character happens to appear in the tail.
#:
#: ReDoS profile is unchanged from the previous literal ``\]``. The class shares
#: no character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*``, and the tempered body
#: already admitted ``]`` via ``[^[\n]``, so adding these three codepoints
#: introduces no new ambiguity.
MARKER_CLOSERS = "]\u3011\uff3d\u3015"

#: Every protocol head a tempered marker body must refuse to cross, as ONE
#: alternation shared by all four patterns below.
#:
#: The tempering exists for ReDoS (see the block above), but once a SECOND head
#: exists it also carries a correctness property the single-head version never
#: had to: a body that forbids only its OWN head still happily consumes the
#: OTHER one. That is not theoretical -- it was MEASURED on the pre-existing
#: ``OPTIONS_RE_TRAILER`` before this list was introduced. Given
#: ``"[OPTIONS: a | b]\n[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=Close this tab]"``, its body
#: crossed the second marker and captured
#: ``" a | b]\n[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=Close this tab"``, so the SECOND marker's
#: raw text became a channel BUTTON LABEL and the real second choice was lost.
#: The mirror case (action head first, ``[OPTIONS:`` last) does the same to the
#: action pattern. Both are silent: the regex matches, the anchor is satisfied,
#: and only the captured label is wrong.
#:
#: Only the ``\Z``-anchored TRAILER forms can actually hit this -- the LINE
#: bodies exclude ``\n`` and both heads own their line -- but the exclusion is
#: applied to BOTH forms anyway, because "which variant is currently reachable"
#: is a property of today's call sites, not of the grammar, and a per-variant
#: exception is exactly the drift these shared definitions exist to prevent.
#:
#: Adding a head here is behaviour-preserving for any text that does not contain
#: it, and stays linear: at each position either the character is not ``[`` (first
#: branch) or it is, and the lookahead alone decides -- the branches remain
#: mutually exclusive, so no new backtracking path is created.
_MARKER_HEADS = ("OPTIONS:", "OPTION-ACTIONS:")
#: Heads matched case-INSENSITIVELY wherever the shared alternation below is used —
#: the temper and the line tail's sibling lookahead. PER-HEAD, because the two
#: markers genuinely differ here: ``OPTION_ACTIONS_RE_*`` carry ``re.IGNORECASE`` to
#: match the frontend's ``i`` flag, so a mixed-case action marker IS a live marker
#: that the dashboard renders a chip for — while ``OPTIONS_RE_*`` stay
#: case-sensitive by a deliberate, documented decision (see below).
#:
#: A case-SENSITIVE temper against a head that its own pattern matches
#: case-insensitively is a contradiction, and it corrupts data rather than merely
#: missing a match. MEASURED on ``[OPTIONS: A] [Option-Actions: close=B]``: the
#: mixed-case sibling is not recognised as a head, so the temper's negative
#: lookahead SUCCEEDS, the content body consumes straight through it, and the
#: captured label becomes ``" A] [Option-Actions: close=B"`` — the action marker
#: delivered to every client as a user-visible option label.
#:
#: ``OPTIONS:`` is deliberately NOT in this set. Widening the content head here
#: would change how every pre-existing ``[OPTIONS:]`` marker on every streamed
#: channel message parses, which is a far larger blast radius than this fix; that
#: divergence from the frontend is pre-existing and stays a called-out follow-up.

# ── "[OPTION-ACTIONS: close=label]" — the zero-turn UI-action marker ─────────
# A SIBLING of the OPTIONS marker, not an extension of it, and the distinct head
# is the entire mechanism. Only the dashboard frontend acts on this one: it
# renders a button that runs a LOCAL UI action (currently just ``close``) with no
# LLM turn. Body is exactly ONE ``<action>=<label>`` entry, where the action is a
# strict enum and the label — everything after the FIRST ``=`` — is free
# text. Two kinds of backend consumer exist: the channel renderers STRIP the
# marker, and ``_has_option_actions`` parses the entry far enough to answer
# whether it would render a chip — splitting on the first ``=``, case-folding the
# action against ``_KNOWN_OPTION_ACTIONS`` and requiring a non-empty label. Only
# DISPATCH is frontend-exclusive; presence is decided here.
#
# WHY a separate head instead of a reserved label or prefix inside ``[OPTIONS:]``:
# option labels are model-emitted prose, so any in-band encoding means an agent
# that merely WRITES ABOUT this feature would emit a live close button and tear
# down the user's tab. The action therefore occupies its own field, and the label
# is never load-bearing.
#
# WHY these patterns are needed at all, given the head is inert for every
# existing parser: inert does not mean invisible. A parser keyed on the
# literal ``[OPTIONS:`` does not MANGLE a non-matching marker — it passes it
# through VERBATIM as visible text. So without a matching strip the marker is
# posted raw into Slack, shown in the sidebar preview, and READ ALOUD by TTS.
# Inertness buys safety from misparsing and costs a leak on every surface; these
# patterns pay that cost back.
#
# Grammar is deliberately IDENTICAL to the OPTIONS pair — same shared tempered
# body, same ``MARKER_CLOSERS`` class incl. the CJK lookalikes, same optional
# stray markdown-link close, same anchors — because the failure modes are the
# same failure modes. A model that substitutes ``】`` for ``]`` or appends a
# ``(OPTIONS)`` tic does so regardless of which head it just wrote, and here the
# consequence of a broken end anchor is strictly worse than a lost button: the
# marker leaks as literal text on every surface listed above. Sharing the pieces
# rather than re-spelling them is what keeps that true as the grammar evolves.
#
# NON-COLLISION, in both directions, is the property the whole design rests on,
# and it is structural rather than incidental: ``OPTIONS_RE_*`` requires the
# literal ``OPTIONS:`` immediately after ``[``, and ``[OPTION-`` cannot supply it;
# these patterns require the literal ``OPTION-ACTIONS:``, which a bare
# ``[OPTIONS:`` cannot supply. Neither can ever parse the other's marker as its
# own, so an action marker never yields content choices and a content marker
# never yields an action. Pinned in both directions by
# ``test/test_option_actions_marker.py``.
#: IGNORECASE, matching the frontend's `gim`: the dashboard renders a live chip for
#: `[Option-Actions: close=…]`, so a case-sensitive backend pattern reports the wrong
#: `has_options` for that row AND leaves the marker in every stripped surface — Slack,
#: TTS, the sidebar preview — where the raw text then reaches the user. Both forms
#: carry the flag, because a divergence between the LINE and TRAILER spellings of ONE
#: marker is the same defect one level down.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT applied to ``OPTIONS_RE_*``: that head has the identical

#: Body for the STRIP pattern below. Distinct from ``_MARKER_BODY_LINE`` on purpose,
#: and the difference is a MEASURED defect in each direction.
#:
#: ``_MARKER_BODY_LINE``'s class is ``[^[\n]`` — it excludes ``[`` and newline but NOT
#: ``]`` — which is safe only because the LINE forms then require ``_MARKER_TAIL_LINE``
#: (end of line, or an abutting sibling marker). The strip pattern has no such anchor,
#: so reusing that body let a greedy match run PAST the marker's own closer to the last
#: closer on the line. MEASURED: ``"See [OPTIONS: A | B] for details [1]"`` was spoken
#: as ``"See"`` — a citation, and every word before it, deleted from the utterance.
#:
#: A lazy ``[^\]]*`` is the other trap, and it was the ORIGINAL defect: it stops at the
#: FIRST closer, so a label carrying a bracket — ``[OPTIONS: do [x] now]`` — left
#: ``now]`` behind to be spoken.
#:
#: So neither existing body serves, and this one stops at the first UNMATCHED closer:
#: either a character that is neither bracket nor newline, or a tempered bracketed span
#: taken as one ATOM. Nothing in the body can consume a bare ``]``, which is precisely
#: why a match cannot cross one.
#:
#: The span appears TWICE, and that is a ReDoS fix rather than duplication. It was one
#: branch whose closer was OPTIONAL, which let a run of plain characters after a ``[`` be
#: divided between the span and the single-character branch in ANY proportion — and that
#: choice multiplies per ``[``, so the cost was exponential in the number of fragments.
#: MEASURED on ``"[OPTIONS: " + "[x" * n``: 0.2ms at n=10, 3.1s at n=24, over 5s at
#: n=26 — a 62-character string, and this body runs on the TTS path, where the caller is
#: ``voice_reply.strip_markdown`` on the gateway's own loop.
#:
#: Splitting it removes the ambiguity because each branch now has a FORCED length: the
#: complete span's closer is REQUIRED, so its run can only end at the one closer it
#: reaches, and the bare branch consumes the ``[`` alone. Complete is tried FIRST, so a
#: balanced label still matches as one atom, while an unbalanced ``[`` falls through to
#: the bare branch — the case the old ``?`` bought, kept without the backtracking that
#: paid for it. Equivalence is not an argument: the two forms were compared over 10,947
#: inputs, 9,849 of which the expression rewrites, and they agree on every one.

# AWS named-profile name shape — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (#6063). The
# charset lived as seven hand-copied compiled patterns, and the copies
# reintroduced the missing-'+' defect twice (#6042, #6055). Every in-package
# validator now derives from these; the two standalone artifact-deploy scripts
# (which cannot import the package) embed AWS_PROFILE_NAME_PATTERN verbatim
# under a byte-equality drift guard in test/test_aws_profile_charset.py.
#
# Semantics (settled by #6051/#6055):
# * '+' admitted — IAM Identity Center derives "<account>+<permission-set>"
#   profile names.
# * The first char excludes '-' so a stored name is never option-shaped when it
#   later reaches a discrete ``--profile <value>`` argv element.
# * \Z anchor — '$' matches just before a trailing newline; \Z rejects it.
#   Call sites that match a raw (unstripped) value rely on this.
# * Length capped at 128 inside the pattern, matching the FieldSpec
#   ``max_len=128`` the deploy boundaries enforce.
#

# legacy continuation charset) derives its character class from these
# fragments rather than re-spelling them. COMPOSE FROM AWS_PROFILE_FIRST_CHARS
# ONLY (it carries no literal '-', so extra chars may follow it safely, e.g.
# rf"[{AWS_PROFILE_FIRST_CHARS}@=-]"). AWS_PROFILE_CHARS ends with a literal
# '-' and is safe ONLY in terminal position — appending anything after it

#: ``{channel}:{agent}:{chatType}:{user}[:genN]`` (see
#: ``messaging.link.build_dm_session_key``), plus the ``unified:`` bucket that
#: ``dm_scope="unified"`` collapses direct DMs into.
#:
#: Deliberately excludes the non-channel namespaces that also contain a colon
#: (``dashboard:``, ``cron:``, ``hook:``, ``subagent:``, ``channel:``) — those
#: are surfaced by their own owners, not by the channel-session reconciler.
#:
#: NOTE: ``autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES`` is a SEPARATE hand-kept copy. It is
#: often described as narrower; as of this writing it is not -- both hold the same
#: 11 namespaces. It answers a different question (does this key SHAPE belong to a
#: channel rather than a dashboard slot), which is why it lists namespaces nothing
#: can currently be delivered to. Deriving it from here would be sound and is
#: deliberately left out of the change that homed this roster; until then, do not
#: assume the two have diverged, and do not assume they are kept in step either.
#:
#: HOMED HERE, not in ``messaging.link``, because the roster has readers on both
#: sides of an import cycle. ``messaging.link`` is itself stdlib-only, but
#: importing anything from it executes ``messaging/__init__.py`` first, which
#: pulls in ``driver`` -> ``acp`` -> ``hooks``; a reader that ``hooks`` is already
#: mid-import for (``hooks`` -> ``webhooks`` -> ``validation``) then fails with a
#: partially-initialized ``hooks``. This module imports only ``os`` and ``re``, so
#: it can be read from anywhere. ``messaging.link`` re-exports both names, which
#: is where the rest of the codebase still reads them from.

#: it already worked (#6514), one level up.
#:

#:
#: * ``slack`` has its own client and streaming path and is deliberately absent
#:   from ``state.channel_transports``, so the shared ladder skips it. It is
#:   spelled ``session="slack"``.

#: The channels an OWNER-DM may be inferred for -- ``send_message``'s channel
#: ``session`` values. A strict subset of :data:`CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES`, because
#: the two ask different questions and only one of them needs an owner.
#:
#: ``channel_type`` names a conversation: the one the calling session already
#: belongs to, or an explicit ``target_id`` the agent supplies. Neither infers a
#: recipient. A channel ``session`` DOES infer one, from
#: ``configured_targets()`` via ``_owner_dm_target``, whose safety claim is that
#: the agent can only reach somebody the USER configured.
#:
#: ``weixin`` and ``wecom`` are excluded because that claim is false on both. Each
#: folds identities LEARNED from inbound traffic into ``configured_targets()`` --
#: Weixin's ``_known_users`` (``_allowed | _known_users``) and WeCom's
#: ``_warm_chats``, which under ``wecom.allow_all_users`` become the list outright
#: ("there is no configured list to draw on, so the warm peers ARE the list"). So a
#: peer who messaged the bot once can be the single available direct target, which
#: is exactly what ``_owner_dm_target`` reads as "the owner". Nothing downstream
#: catches it: both transports' ``may_send_to`` returns True unconditionally under
#: their open policy (Weixin's promise to consult ``_allowed`` alone holds only on
#: its ``allowlist`` branch), and ``resolve_configured_target`` accepts the learned
#: set too. So private agent output would reach an arbitrary peer, not the operator.
#:
#: The other seven transports draw ``configured_targets()`` from configured state
#: alone; ``test_no_owner_dm_channel_advertises_learned_identities`` is the ratchet
#: that keeps this subtraction honest rather than hand-kept, so a transport that
#: starts mixing learned identities in fails the gate instead of silently becoming
#: an owner-DM target.
#:
#: This is a per-channel CAPABILITY gap, not drift: the exclusion is derived from
#: the send roster and carries its reason, the way ``slack`` and ``unified`` do. A
#: channel graduates by distinguishing configured recipients from learned peers in
#: ``configured_targets()`` -- at which point deleting it from this subtraction is
#: the whole change.
