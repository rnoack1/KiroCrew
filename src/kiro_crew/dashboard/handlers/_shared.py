    """Read and parse a JSON *object* request body, capped at *max_bytes*.

    Returns ``(body, None)`` on success, or ``(None, error_response)`` when the
    caller should return early. This owns the parse-and-shape guard for the
    endpoints routed through it: ``await request.json()`` happily returns a
    list, string, or number for a body that is valid JSON but not an object, and
    a handler that then calls ``.get()`` on the result turns a client mistake
    into a 500 (issue #5587).

    NOT yet the dashboard's only such guard. Four siblings survive and diverge:
    ``handlers_channel._json_object`` (same ``invalid_json``/``body_not_object``
    codes, but raises ``HTTPBadRequest`` instead of returning the response),
    ``handlers/hooks.py::_json_object`` (``default_empty=True`` collapses a
    MALFORMED body to defaults -- the defect this issue fixed in
    ``api_memory_promote``), ``handlers/session_storage.py::_json_body``
    (deliberately different: an empty body is legitimate there, and it
    documents why), and ``handlers/artifacts.py::_read_json_body`` (raises
    ``ArtifactValidationError``, carries its own cap). Folding or narrowing each
    is tracked on issue #5587 alongside the remaining handler sweep -- claiming
    one owner before that is done would be a claim the tree does not support.

    The cap is enforced BEFORE decoding: a Content-Length precheck rejects an
    oversized declared body, and the stream is then read incrementally so a
    chunked body (which carries no Content-Length) cannot buffer past
    ``max_bytes + one chunk`` on the event-loop thread. That bound is the point
    of the helper for the strict-internal notification routes (issue #490).

    ``max_bytes=None`` reads the body whole with no pre-decode ceiling, for the
    endpoints that have no principled byte limit today (a knowledge bundle
    import has no defensible maximum size). It is deliberately explicit rather
    than the default: an endpoint opting out of the cap should say so at the
    call site, and giving one of those endpoints a real ceiling later is then a
    one-argument change here instead of a re-plumb.

    Which one a converting caller wants is a real choice, not a default to
    inherit: take the cap when the body is a fixed set of control fields (an
    identifier, a flag, a number), and ``None`` only when the body legitimately
    carries user content of unbounded size (file contents, an export, a fetched
    document). Note that switching a site TO the cap also moves it off
    ``request.json()`` onto the streaming read, so that handler's unit tests
    must feed ``content``/``content_length`` rather than mocking ``json``.

    *allow_absent* treats a request with no readable body as an empty object,
    for endpoints whose fields all have defaults. A body that is *present but
    malformed* is still a 400 -- "the client sent nothing" and "the client sent
    garbage" are different facts, and only the first one can be defaulted.

    Decoding matches ``request.json()`` on both paths -- ``decode(charset or
    utf-8)`` then ``loads`` -- so the two differ only in whether the read is
    bounded, and the declared ``charset=`` is honoured either way. The uncapped
    path calls ``request.json()`` itself rather than reimplementing it, which is
    what makes converting a ``try: await request.json()`` site a drop-in: no
    handler and no test harness sees a different read.

    The catch is narrowed to the three client-input failures -- ``ValueError``
    (which covers ``json.JSONDecodeError`` and ``UnicodeDecodeError``),
    ``LookupError`` (an unknown ``charset=`` codec), and ``RecursionError`` (a
    deeply nested document blowing the parser's stack). Transport failures (a
    disconnect mid-body, a read timeout) deliberately propagate: they are not a
    client JSON mistake and keep their 500 status class.

    Validation uses HOST semantics, because enumeration and resolution run on the
    SAME host and the binding contract is between those two: every catalogued key
    must resolve. Asking ``ntpath`` unconditionally broke that. ``ntpath.splitdrive``
    treats ANY single character before ``:`` as a drive, so ``a:b`` was refused
    everywhere — while on POSIX ``a:b`` is a legal directory name that the enumerator
    happily catalogues, leaving the pair catalogued-but-unresolvable. That is not the
    fail-closed direction; it is the phantom row. On Windows such a directory cannot
    exist, so refusing it there costs nothing and keeps the glob from raising.

    Host semantics is also interpreter-stable, which was the reason the flavour's
    ``.drive`` was avoided: pathlib only adopted the permissive drive rule in 3.12, so
    ``PureWindowsPath("~:x").drive`` is empty on 3.10/3.11 and ``"~:"`` on 3.12.
    ``os.path.splitdrive`` is ``posixpath``'s (always no drive) or ``ntpath``'s (the
    permissive rule, measured identical on 3.10-3.12) — never the version-dependent
    one.

    A component carrying ANY glob metacharacter — ``*``, ``?`` or ``[`` — is refused,
    for the two different reasons they are wrong. ``**`` EMBEDDED in a component
    (``***``, ``a**b``) is an INVALID pattern and ``Path.glob`` raises ``ValueError:
    Invalid pattern: '**' can only be an entire path component`` — the same
    500-instead-of-404 this predicate exists to stop, just a different exception type
    than the non-relative case above. Every other spelling is VALID but is a WILDCARD,
    so the key would not name a directory: ``**`` matches at any depth, ignoring
    ``_SKILL_NEST_DEPTH``, while ``*``, ``?`` and ``[`` match SIBLINGS — so one key
    resolves to whichever skill happens to match, or to several, which is the
    one-key-two-skills divergence the reserved separator exists to prevent.

    Refusing them cannot strand a row, because :func:`_merge_package_walks` holds every
    walked rel to this SAME predicate and omits what it refuses. An earlier revision
    admitted a single ``*`` or ``?`` precisely to avoid that phantom row, when only
    separator-carrying rels were omitted; the enumerator mirror removed the tradeoff, so
    the narrow admission is no longer needed and the ambiguity is no longer worth
    carrying. The declared cost is the same class as the separator's: a skill directory
    named with a glob metacharacter is invisible in the catalog and 404s on open — and
    the same now holds for a name CONTAINING ``..``, which the resolver's own first gate
    refuses as a substring (see the inline note below).

    """Find SKILL.md for an edition-contributed skill by its key remainder.

    Searched over the ``package/`` territory of the edition skill roots
    (:func:`_edition_package_roots`) — NOT every advertised root. A root the core
    already keys as ``kiro-user/`` or unprefixed is excluded, so a
    ``package/<name>`` request can never be answered with the user's own editable
    skill; *canonical* lets a caller that knows the active project add
    ``<project>/.kiro/skills`` to that exclusion.

    Two layouts are supported, in precedence order:

    1. ``<root>/<name>/SKILL.md`` — *name* is the path relative to the root, which
       is how a row keyed ``package/<rel>`` addresses its file.
    2. ``<root>/<pkg>/<name>/SKILL.md`` — *name* is a leaf under some package
       directory, for an edition that keys rows by leaf.

    An exact relative-path hit wins over a nested leaf hit. Within a tier, two
    DISTINCT files matching is a genuine ambiguity — the same relative path
    bundled by two packages — so it returns ``None`` and logs instead of picking
    one. Serving an arbitrary one of the two looks completely successful and shows
    the wrong skill's content, which is the failure mode worth being loud about.

    *qualifier* is how a caller resolves that ambiguity, and it is the CANONICAL
    catalog-derived value for the wanted copy's root — the identity digest
    :func:`_root_identity_token` derives — not any segment that root happens to carry. So for
    roots ``packages/PkgA/eventId-1/skills`` and ``packages/PkgB/eventId-2/skills`` the
    qualifiers are the two roots' digests, and neither ``package/PkgA:<rel>`` nor
    ``package/eventId-1:<rel>`` resolves even though both name a unique segment of one
    root: the catalogue never offers those spellings, and answering one would be
    answering a key ``/tree`` does not list.

    That narrowing is deliberate and is the invariant this grammar exists to restore
    (see :func:`_merge_package_walks`): every key enumeration EMITS resolves, so a
    qualified key resolves to the copy the catalogue would list it for, or to nothing.
    The converse does not hold — resolution also accepts a leaf-name key through its
    nested tier — so this is one direction, not an inverse.
    Accepting any carried segment instead is what let a stale key bind to a DIFFERENT
    bundle — uninstall the root a qualifier was derived from, install another that also
    carries that segment, and the same key silently served the new bundle's content.

    Selection still applies to ROOTS and never to assembled candidate paths, because a
    candidate's segments cannot tell a root segment from a relative-path segment: testing
    candidates would let a qualifier match inside another root's rel and serve that
    bundle's file. A root that is not among the copies of this rel yields nothing, so
    ``package/PkgB:shared-skill`` does not answer with ``PkgA``'s copy when only ``PkgA``
    bundles that path.

    The core still needs no root-to-package mapping: the qualifier is derived from the
    root's own canonical path, and that knowledge belongs to whichever edition installs
    the roots. A qualifier that is not a digest any installed root yields narrows to no
    roots rather than to all of them, so an unrecognised one answers nothing.

    traversing key (``../../.ssh``, an absolute path, a ``~`` prefix) can do
    nothing but miss a dict lookup. Allowlist by enumeration rather than
    validate-then-join — it also removes the tainted-path dataflow that
    validate-then-join leaves for static analysis to flag.

    *session_key* only selects which project's ``kiro-workspace/`` root joins
    the walk (see :func:`_skill_key_roots`); it never widens the enumeration
    property above. Results are computed per call — nothing is cached — so a
    per-session root cannot leak into another session's catalog.

    It is additionally the single source of truth for BOTH directions of the
    key <-> URI mapping, so they cannot disagree: a mapping written against a
    symlinked skill directory inverts back to the same key it was written from.

    ``package/`` roots are walked separately and folded in by
    :func:`_merge_package_walks`, because whether a relative path needs a
    qualifier is only knowable once every package root has been walked.

def _root_identity_token(root: Path) -> str | None:
    """The qualifier for *root*: a stable, collision-resistant token for its identity.

    A qualifier answers one question — WHICH of several roots bundling the same relative
    path does this key mean — so the only thing it carries is *root*'s own identity, and
    it must be an identity rather than a distinguishing path segment. A segment is chosen
    against whichever roots collide at derivation time, so a root that is REPLACED
    (uninstalled, and a different root installed that still carries the same segment,
    e.g. ``<...>/A/skills`` giving way to ``<...>/A/v2/skills``) would re-derive the very
    same qualifier. A key an editor still holds would then resolve to a DIFFERENT file,
    and because the agent-config write path (:func:`apply_skill_mapping`) resolves keys
    against a FRESH catalog at write time, it would persist a ``skill://`` URI for a
    skill the user never selected — silent, and durable in the agent's config.

    This token closes that, and both of its halves matter. It is derived from the root's
    own CANONICAL path, so it is the same for the same root no matter what else is
    installed or removed alongside it: a key stays valid across an unrelated bundle
    install, and the editor's held key and the agent config's persisted URI keep meaning
    what they meant. And a DIFFERENT root cannot produce it, so a stale key cannot
    RE-BIND to another root — it fails to resolve instead, which the write path turns
    into a whole-request rejection, so nothing is written at all. That last claim is
    only as strong as the digest is wide: a narrow one can be GROUND against, so an
    install path could be chosen to collide with a key already minted for another root.
    :data:`_ROOT_IDENTITY_DIGEST_BYTES` is the bound that makes the search infeasible
    rather than merely unlikely.

    Lowercase hex is also already key-safe: it carries neither
    :data:`_SKILL_KEY_QUALIFIER_SEP` nor a glob metacharacter nor a traversal element, so
    the key round-trips without a per-candidate filter. What it gives up is legibility —
    ``package/a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890:tool`` does not say which bundle it means. The omission
    warnings carry the absolute path instead, which is the surface a reader needs, and a
    resolved row still shows its own file.

    Canonical and not the advertised path, so an edition that advertises one root
    through a symlink alias keeps ONE identity. ``blake2b`` and not ``hash()``, which
    is salted per process and would mint a different key on every restart. A root that
    does not canonicalise yields ``None`` and the caller omits the path: identity that
    cannot be established fails closed.

    The single dedupe for both sides of the grammar: the enumerator's collision fold and
    the resolver's tier loop. One skill is routinely reachable through two roots — an
    edition may advertise both a directory and a symlink into it — and that is NOT an
    ambiguity; only distinct FILES are. Qualified keys are emitted per distinct COPY, so
    a third root holding a symlink to another root's copy is a genuine collision by
    count yet the same file: iterating raw entries would give it its own key pointing at
    a file another key already names, two catalog rows for one skill.

    **Containment is enforced here, on the CANONICAL forms of both sides.** ``Path.glob``
    matches a symlinked directory's dirent and yields a path that is LEXICALLY under the
    root while resolving anywhere on the filesystem, so a skill directory — or any
    intermediate directory on the way to it — that is a symlink pointing outside the root
    would otherwise hand the detail endpoint a file outside the package territory
    entirely. A prefix test on the unresolved path cannot see that, and neither can the
    glob result itself; only ``resolve()`` on both sides can. That makes this the one
    place the check belongs: all three call sites (both resolver tiers and the fold) pass
    through it, so enumeration and resolution refuse the same entries by construction
    rather than by two rules kept in step by hand — an escaping entry omitted from only
    one side would be a catalogued row that 404s on open, or a resolvable key ``/tree``
    never lists.

    ``Path.resolve()`` raises ``RuntimeError`` (not ``OSError``) on a symlink loop, and a
    looping ``SKILL.md`` IS yielded by ``glob`` because a literal pattern matches the
    dirent without following it. Catching only ``OSError`` would turn that into a 500 on
    a browser-triggered request, so an unresolvable entry is skipped instead: it cannot
    be read anyway. An unresolvable ROOT fails the same way — closed, not open, since

      file, contained by its root (see :func:`_dedupe_entries`).
    * *qualifiers* is one qualifier per entry of *copies*, in the same order, or
      ``None`` when this rel has no addressable qualified spelling at all.

    ``None`` covers BOTH of the ways that happens, because both mean the catalogue
    offers no qualified key: fewer than two distinct copies (so the rel is keyed
    unqualified), or a collision in which some root does not canonicalise and so yields
    no identity. Callers distinguish the two by ``len(copies)``, which is what lets
    enumeration mint the unqualified key in the first case and omit in the second, while
    resolution refuses in both.

    The all-or-nothing shape is kept as a FAIL-CLOSED backstop rather than a rule that
    fires in normal operation. Since :func:`_root_identity_token` is a digest of the root's
    own canonical path, every root that canonicalises yields one, and two distinct roots
    cannot yield the same one — so neither the missing-qualifier nor the duplicate branch
    is reachable except when the filesystem refuses to canonicalise a root.

    **Both sides call this rather than each computing it**, and that is the point: every

    in how the two build this set is a phantom row — a key ``/tree`` lists and ``detail``
    404s. That is the direction this shares, and it is the whole of it: resolution is
    deliberately WIDER than enumeration, because the resolver also accepts a leaf-name
    key through its nested tier, so a rel the catalog lists at its full relative path
    stays reachable under the bare leaf. Two copies of the rule agreeing today is not

    A relative path found in one root only — or found in several that all reach

    single key cannot address: whichever root won ``setdefault`` produced a key
    the resolver then refused, so the entry was a phantom in the editor. Those

    A relative path is OMITTED and logged only when the collision has no addressable
    qualified spelling at all: a root that does not canonicalise yields no identity, so
    :func:`_package_collision` returns no qualifiers. That is a fail-closed backstop

    Omitting keeps the documented invariant absolute — every key this walk offers is one

    A relative path that itself contains the qualifier separator is omitted for the

    literal name. So such a path is not addressable under this grammar at all.

    A qualified key is written unconditionally. This helper does NOT re-check whether
    the key is already taken, because it cannot be: the caller prunes every

    Returns ``(carried_claims, ttl_ceiling_seconds)``. ``ttl_ceiling`` is ``0``
    when the caller has no lifetime left to lend, which the handler refuses

    Only that credential has a verified signature; the other one was never

    to the session cookie when the query token is invalid, so re-deriving with
    a fixed query-then-cookie order could pick the credential that was NOT
    validated — letting a request that authenticated with a bounded cookie have
    its bounds read from an unverified, attacker-settable query token, dropping
    ``no_refresh`` and raising the TTL ceiling to the full maximum, which is
    precisely the ceiling-escape this function exists to prevent. When no
    credential was published (a surface that authenticated by another means),
    the mint is bounded fail-closed the same way an unreadable payload is.

    **A non-positive remaining lifetime is never rounded up.** Clamping it to a
    floor of one second would let a caller whose own session has just run out
    mint a link that outlives it, and the exchange the recipient performs starts
    a fresh window — so repeating the mint would walk the expiry forward
    indefinitely from a session that should already be dead. Report ``0`` and

      metadata line. A metadata line that parses but carries no ``memory_mode``
      is reported as ``"persistent"``: the field postdates the feature, so a
      valid header without it is genuinely a legacy persistent session.
    * ``None`` — **unknown**. No file, or no parseable metadata object as the
      first line. Callers gating memory writes MUST deny on ``None`` rather
      than treat it as persistent. Denying is safe: ``ConversationLog.append``
      writes the metadata line when it creates the file, before any message is
      appended, so a session file whose first line is not metadata was not
      produced by a normal session and is no evidence that writes are allowed.

    This is the recovery path for a session whose in-memory state is gone but
    whose transcript is still on disk. Both in-memory signals a restricted
    session normally carries are dropped when a tab is archived
    (``api_chat_slot_close`` removes the slot from ``state._slots`` *and*
    discards its key from ``state._restricted_keys``), while the transcript —
    including its ``memory_mode`` marker — persists. Without reading that
    marker back, an archived incognito session whose MCP subprocess is still
    alive presents as an ordinary established session and its memory writes
    are allowed.

    Only the FIRST line is consulted, and only ``_METADATA_HEAD_MAX_BYTES`` of
    it: a later ``_type: metadata`` object is message content, not the header,
    and must not be able to redefine the mode. Byte-bounding keeps an enormous
    or adversarial first line from pinning memory.
