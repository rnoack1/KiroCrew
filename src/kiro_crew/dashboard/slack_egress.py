"""Hardened proactive Slack egress. One hardened chain, three shared names.

WHAT IS SHARED TODAY, as a count rather than an intention:
``channel_egress_permitted`` (the compaction notice and this module's own chain),
``OFFERED_ACTIVATIONS`` (``chat_slack``) and ``audit_egress`` (the note mirror's
two refusal sites plus this chain). The hardened chain itself,
``_deliver_slack_governed``, has exactly ONE consumer -- the note mirror's Slack
leg -- so this module is a shared HOME for the gates and a single-consumer home
for the chain. Naming that plainly here rather than calling the whole module
"shared across features": a reader who takes the chain for a repo-wide invariant
will assume protection that four direct senders and seven resolve-then-send
sites do not have.

A *proactive* Slack send has no inbound message to answer -- a cron result, a
compaction notice, a note mirrored to the session's channel -- so it names its own
recipient, and nothing in the request proves that recipient is still authorized.
This module is where the ``/note`` mirror chain decides. It is NOT the single
gate for proactive Slack generally: other proactive senders still reach
``slack_client.post_message`` directly (compaction notices, channel replies and
DMs, chat-runner mirrors), so treat the guarantees below as scoped to callers that
actually route through ``_deliver_slack_governed`` rather than as a repo-wide
invariant. Those senders are named, tier by tier, at their own send sites and in
the census that pins them; whether they adopt this chain is not decided here.

It lives here rather than beside any one caller BY DESIGN. It began inside the
compaction-notice module because that was its first consumer, which made a
cross-feature boundary look like a feature detail: the next caller either misses
it or copies it, and a copied egress check is one that stops being re-verified.
The boundary is the module.

The sequence a caller gets, in order, is what makes it hardened:

* **recipient authorization** -- ``_slack_recipient_basis`` names WHICH authority
  permits this recipient (session principal, tracked channel, configured channel,
  owner DM) and fails closed when none does. Four, not three: a channel the
  picker OFFERED is a valid destination for a note, and omitting it here would
  describe a narrower authority set than the module grants.
* **governance** -- ``channel_egress_permitted`` vets the send against the
  ``channels`` scope and records a SEL decision for grant AND denial.
* **a synchronous last word** -- both checks above await, so the decision cannot
  be carried across them. Only the NAME of the authority is, and it is
  re-asserted synchronously immediately before the send.
* **per-chunk revalidation** -- a long message is chunked, and the whole chain is
  re-asked per chunk, because revocation mid-send must stop the remainder.

Any binding disagreement is a REFUSAL, never a retarget: delivering to the
replacement conversation is the exposure the checks exist to prevent.

    the governance permit is stale; put it before and the config permit is. One hop

    Covers exactly the ``/note`` channel mirror. It is NOT what every proactive
    non-turn Slack egress goes through: reading it as a repo-wide guarantee would
    let the next reader assume a site is protected because this function exists.
    Four proactive Slack sends post directly instead:

    * ``dashboard/server.py`` ``_dm_owner`` -- the unattended-expiry owner DM.
    * ``dashboard/handlers/hooks.py`` -- the hook-result owner DM.
    * ``dashboard/handlers/messaging.py`` ``api_send_message`` -- its Slack leg,
      which carries its own allowlist check rather than this chain.
    * ``dashboard/chat_compaction_notice.py`` ``_deliver_slack`` -- the
      auto-compaction channel notice, which stays on the shared
      ``channel_egress_permitted`` gate.

    Adopting any of them widens its refusal set, which is a behaviour change to a
    surface this chain does not otherwise touch, so each belongs in a change where
    that tightening is the subject under review rather than a rider. The
    compaction notice is on that list for the same reason.

    Seven resolve-then-send siblings are also deferred, and are listed by SYMBOL
    rather than by line so the follow-up can be filed against something that does
    not rot: each resolves a link, awaits, and then sends on the value captured
    before that await, with no re-walk. Seven SITES across five symbols -- the
    ``chat_mirror`` entry carries three distinct resolve-then-send paths in one
    function:

    * ``dashboard/state.py`` ``_notify_inbound_unbind``.
    * ``dashboard/chat_mirror.py`` ``api_chat_slot_mirror_link`` -- three paths.
    * ``slack/gateway.py`` ``_deliver_channel_reply``.
    * ``dashboard/handlers/messaging.py`` ``_deliver_channel_dm``.
    * ``dashboard/chat_compaction_notice.py`` ``_deliver_via_transport`` -- reads
      the link, resolves it off the loop, then sends on the captured value. It is
      the TRANSPORT leg of the compaction notice and a separate site from that
      module's Slack leg, which is listed among the four direct sends above.

    Fixing them is a general change across five more modules and belongs in its own
    change; they are named here so the gap is not mistaken for coverage.

    Slack is deliberately absent from ``channel_transports``, so it never reaches
    ``_resolve_channel_target``'s ladder and gets none of that ladder's protection
    for free. This is where that protection lives instead, in ONE copy: governance
    gate, recipient authorization, coordinate and pause revalidation after every
    await, per-transport chunking, and abort-on-revocation between chunks.

    The flush-time mirror is now CLOSED: a note held while a turn runs carries the
    destinations it was authored for on its held record, and ``flush_deferred_notes``
    dispatches them once both halves commit. That covers the mid-turn case background
    senders mostly hit, which was the largest remaining gap in this list.

    This function is PRIVATE, and deliberately so: it has exactly one consumer
    (``chat_note_mirror._deliver_slack``). The module's shared surface is
    ``channel_egress_permitted`` and ``OFFERED_ACTIVATIONS`` -- the two names with
    counted cross-module consumers. The tool identity is a module constant rather
    than a parameter for the same reason: one caller only ever passed one value, so
    the parameter was scaffolding for an adopter that does not exist yet.
    Reintroduce both the parameter and the public name with the second adopter,
    which is also when "shared across features" starts being a count rather than a
    promise. ``channel_egress_permitted`` beside it is the measured case for this
    file existing at all: two consumers in two modules (this chain and the
    compaction notice), so the alternative is a duplicated fail-closed gate, which
    is how the two copies drift -- the unhardened twin is exactly what happened
    while this lived inside the note module.

    *relink* re-reads the binding for the post-await coordinate checks -- the
    caller knows where a link comes from, and re-reading is the whole point, so it
    cannot be a captured value. *is_paused* is REQUIRED, not optional: a send that
    cannot answer "was this paused underneath me" has no business completing, so
    the check is part of the contract rather than something a call site can leave
    off. An optional predicate makes omitting it an accident; a required one makes
    it impossible.

    RETURNS NOTHING. Its one consumer discarded the bool, and every outcome this
    chain can reach already files a SEL row naming it, so the value duplicated the
    audit trail for no reader. A future adopter that genuinely needs the verdict
    should take it from the row rather than reintroduce a second source of truth.

async def _slack_recipient_basis(

) -> str:
    """Which authority permits this Slack conversation, or ``""`` if none does.

    Returns the BASIS rather than a bare bool, because the caller has to re-assert
    it synchronously immediately before sending: this function awaits (the
    owner-DM branch resolves ``conversations.open``), and so does the governance
    re-check that follows it, so a bool captured here is stale by send time. The
    basis names which authority to re-ask, and three of the FOUR -- session
    principal, tracked channel and owner DM -- can be re-asked with no await and no
    I/O at all. The fourth, the configured channel, is read off the loop in the same
    hop as the governance re-check and passed in, so the re-assertion itself stays
    synchronous -- see ``_authority_still_holds``.

    The transport leg gets recipient re-authorization from the shared ladder
    (``transport.may_send_to``). Slack does not: it is absent from the transport
    registry, and ``SlackTransport.may_send_to`` documents that it could not
    answer anyway, because a Slack link persists a CONVERSATION id (``D…``/``C…``)
    while the roster holds USER ids. So the check has to be made here, against the
    authorities that can actually judge it — and it must be made at SEND time, not
    at link time: a link is persisted once and outlives the roster that authorized
    it, so a recipient removed from the allow-list afterwards keeps receiving every
    note until something re-asks.

    Four authorities, tried in order:

    1. the principal the SESSION KEY names, for a 1:1 channel-born session —
       ``_session_principal`` exists precisely because the link records a
       conversation rather than a person.
    2. the tracked-channel roster, for a conversation configured as a
       destination. Untracking it is the revocation.
    3. the CONFIGURED channel, for a channel the dashboard's own link picker
       OFFERS in an activation mode from ``OFFERED_ACTIVATIONS``. Such a channel
       carries no principal, is not on the separate tracking roster, and is not a
       ``D…`` owner DM, so without this authority the other three all decline and
       a note the product invited the user to bind is dropped silently.
       Deactivating the channel in config is the revocation.
    4. the OWNER'S DM. A dashboard-created link is the default case and lands
       here: it carries no principal (a ``dashboard:`` key names no peer) and its
       ``D…`` id is not a tracked channel, and it is not a configured channel
       either, so all three authorities above decline a conversation that is in
       fact the intended destination. Resolved through the
       owner identity that created the link — ``conversations.open`` is idempotent
       and returns the same ``D…`` for the same user, so comparing against it is an
       identity check rather than a guess. Revocation still works: changing
       ``owner_id`` changes the DM this resolves to.

    EVERY return is audited, allow and deny alike. A denial-only audit answers
    "was anything refused" but not "who was this note authorized to reach", and on
    a security control the successful decision is the one an operator needs when
    reconstructing what left the building.

    FAIL-CLOSED: no authority answering is a refusal, not a pass. This feeds a
    network egress boundary, so "cannot tell" and "not authorized" must have the
    same outcome — the stance ``_resolve_channel_target`` also takes when its
    allow-list check raises.
