"""Channel delivery for ``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/note`` visible lines.

``/note`` writes two halves: a visible transcript line and a ``_pending_context``
entry drained onto the next user message. The context half is already
surface-agnostic — ``drain_pending_context`` runs inside ``_run_chat``, the one
runner every inbound surface goes through, so a note reaches the model whether
the next message is typed in the dashboard, Slack or Telegram.

The visible half was not. ``slot.append(broadcast=True)`` fans out over the
dashboard's own SSE/WS and nothing else, and every channel egress in the turn
loop (the user echo, the tool stream, the assistant reply, an approval prompt, an
auth error) is a separate site the note path never reached. So a session driven
from a channel got an agent that silently knew something its user was never
shown: the note had no visible provenance on the surface they were reading. That
is worse than no delivery — a missing notice is noticed, invisible provenance is
not.

Delivery reuses the two existing outbound paths rather than adding a third:

* **Slack** — ``state.slack_client.post_message``. Slack is deliberately absent
  from the ``channel_transports`` registry so it cannot ride the ladder, and it
  is the one channel that can be bound two ways: as a session's own origin
  (a Slack-born thread) or as a dashboard slot's mirror (``_slack_linked``).
  Both resolve here.
* **every other channel** — ``handlers.messaging.deliver_to_channel``, the
  shared governed proactive send. It owns the ladder resolve, the ``channels``
  governance gate, the recipient re-authorization, ``display_safe_for``, the
  per-transport chunking, ``delivery_confirmed`` and the SEL audit. This module
  deliberately does NOT re-spell any of that: a second copy drifts, dropping the
  audit and the confirmation check —
  so the only thing kept here is the one decision the shared helper does not
  make, which is skipping a PAUSED binding and continuing the ladder.

Both legs can fire for one note: a dashboard slot can hold a Slack thread link
and a non-Slack mirror at once, and each is a conversation with a user in it.

Best-effort by construction. The transcript line and the context entry are the
note's contract; a channel that is unreachable, paused, ungoverned or incapable
of a proactive send is logged and swallowed rather than failing the POST.

    Returns nothing, and neither do the legs. Whether a leg delivered is a fact
    only its own log line and SEL rows carry: this function's caller dispatches
    in the background and has no one to report to, so a return value here would
    be surface no production code can consume.

    Absorbs both a stall and a raise so neither can reach the caller, because the
    OTHER leg's delivery is still owed and because the endpoint dispatches this in
    the background -- an escaping exception there would surface only as an
    unhandled-task warning, never as anything a caller could act on. A stall and a
    raise are logged apart because they need different operator responses -- a live
    channel that stopped answering versus a composition or transport fault.

    *audit_timeout* is supplied by the caller rather than chosen here, because the
    row belongs in the leg's OWN stream and only the caller holds that leg's
    identifiers. Branching on *leg* instead would put a second emitter in this
    module, which is the divergence ``audit_channel_send`` exists to avoid.

    SEQUENTIAL BY DESIGN, one leg after the other, and the reason is specific:
    running the legs concurrently makes both race the governance profile store's
    cold first load, which is fail-closed and DENIES the loser ("profile store not
    yet loaded (concurrent first load)"). Concurrency would therefore drop a real
    delivery on the first note after a restart -- one leg denied by nothing but
    the presence of its sibling.

    *timeout* BOUNDS THE LEG at ``_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_S`` PER PROJECTED CHUNK rather than
    by one flat deadline, and there is no arm that disables it: a leg runs in a
    background task, so one that never returns is never discarded from the
    dispatcher's task set, and because the legs are sequential a leg that hangs also
    means the OTHER leg is never reached -- the note goes nowhere and the process
    keeps the task for its lifetime. Repeated notes then accumulate them.

    Bounding a chunk loop can leave a delivered PREFIX when the deadline fires, and
    that cost is real: a reader seeing three of eight parts cannot tell it from a
    note that was only ever three parts long. It is accepted here because it is
    ALREADY the behaviour of both helpers a leg calls -- each aborts mid-send and
    returns failure when a binding is revoked between parts, leaving the parts
    already sent in place, and each says so in its own comment. So a partial note is
    a case this chain already handles and reports; a leg that never returns is not.

    Scaling the bound per chunk is what keeps it from being the flat deadline the
    earlier design rejected: a leg sending eight parts gets eight chunks' grace, so
    the bound only fires when a leg is genuinely not progressing rather than when it
    is merely long. That bound is the ONLY limit on a leg -- there is no second,
    up-front size refusal, because a capped note cannot project past it.

    deferred lookup select the replacement thread and expose a note authored for
    the previous one -- delivery to a recipient it was never authorized for. So
    the coordinates are captured HERE, synchronously, on the caller's side of the

    WHERE A SESSION STORE EXISTS, THE STORE IS THE ONLY SOURCE. A complete
    persisted link is the binding; anything else is UNBOUND, and the slot fields are
    not consulted. That is stricter than it first looks necessary, and the reason is
    that the two surfaces go stale in one direction only: several writers persist a
    new link WITHOUT touching the slot fields (``slack.handler._on_applied`` at the
    privacy-mode apply, the interactions handler, and the runner's relink), so a slot
    bound earlier keeps STALE attributes indefinitely. An earlier revision read the

    resurrects the superseded slot binding, posting the note into a conversation the
    session has moved off. Falling back cannot distinguish "not written yet" from
    "deliberately cleared", so it cannot be done safely at all.

    The cost is a dashboard slot linked in this process before its row is written:
    its note does not reach Slack. That is the same answer this function already
    gives when the lookup RAISES, and for the same reason -- a binding we cannot
    read is one we cannot claim to have authorized, and a background note that goes
    nowhere is strictly cheaper than one that reaches the wrong audience.

    #      the governance check and none of the per-chunk revalidation.

    #        * ``handlers/messaging.py`` ``api_send_message``'s SLACK leg -- the
    #          LLM-facing tool, so the highest-consequence of these. Note its
    #          TRANSPORT leg IS hardened by this PR; the gap is Slack-side only.
    #        * ``server.py`` ``_dm_owner`` -- operator DMs.
    #        * ``handlers/hooks.py`` -- the hook notification DM.
    #
    # Deferred here is the CHAIN, not mid-send revalidation: that is adopted for EVERY
    # caller including `api_send_message`, deliberately, and pinned by its own test.
    #
    # THE TRIGGER FOR COLLAPSING THE TIERS, so this does not sit as an untracked
    # intention: extract the shared per-chunk loop driver WHEN THE SECOND ADOPTER OF
    # THIS CHAIN ARRIVES -- not before (one consumer cannot show which parts are
    # genuinely shared) and not later (a third hand-written chain is how the copies
    # drift, which is this change's own thesis). ``kiro_crew.messaging.renderer`` is
    # the cycle-free home: ``slack_egress`` and ``handlers/messaging`` BOTH already
    # import ``chunk_text`` from it and it imports neither of them back. What is
    # shareable is the loop driver alone; the authority sets are not (Slack sits
    # outside ``channel_transports`` and never reaches the transport ladder), nor is
    # the delivery-confirmation predicate or the audit vocabulary.
    #
    # A future caller adopting this chain must accept that widening deliberately.

    Returns nothing, and deliberately reports neither WHETHER nor WHERE: the
    channel type the ladder selected reaches the log line the ladder itself
    writes, and no caller collects an outcome.

    Everything is the shared helper's: the origin-then-mirror walk, the pause
    skip, the governance gate, the recipient re-authorization,
    ``display_safe_for``, the per-transport chunking, ``delivery_confirmed``, the
    post-await revalidation and the SEL audit. This function contributes only the
    ``skip_paused`` intent.

    It deliberately does NOT name a ``channel_type`` and does not pre-read the
    link. Reading the link here to label the result and passing that type in
    would break the case this pairing exists for: with a PAUSED
    origin on one transport and an ACTIVE mirror on another, the caller's
    pause-blind read names the origin's type while the pause-aware ladder selects
    the mirror, and the type-match guard then rejected the live destination. The
    ladder selects, and the ladder logs which row it chose.
