"""Channel delivery for ``POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/note`` visible lines.

``/note`` writes two halves: a visible transcript line and a ``_pending_context``
entry drained onto the next user message. The context half is already
surface-agnostic — ``drain_pending_context`` runs inside ``_run_chat``, the one
runner every inbound surface goes through, so a note reaches the model whether
the next message is typed in the dashboard, Slack or Telegram.

The visible half was not. ``slot.append(broadcast=True)`` fans out over the
dashboard's own SSE/WS and nothing else, and every channel egress in the turn
loop (the user echo, the tool stream, the assistant reply, an approval prompt, an
auth error) is a separate site the note path never reached. So a session driven
from a channel got an agent that silently knew something its user was never
shown: the note had no visible provenance on the surface they were reading. That
is worse than no delivery — a missing notice is noticed, invisible provenance is
not.

Delivery reuses the two existing outbound paths rather than adding a third:

* **Slack** — ``state.slack_client.post_message``. Slack is deliberately absent
  from the ``channel_transports`` registry so it cannot ride the ladder, and it
  is the one channel that can be bound two ways: as a session's own origin
  (a Slack-born thread) or as a dashboard slot's mirror (``_slack_linked``).
  Both resolve here.
* **every other channel** — ``handlers.messaging.deliver_to_channel``, the
  shared governed proactive send. It owns the ladder resolve, the ``channels``
  governance gate, the recipient re-authorization, ``display_safe_for``, the
  per-transport chunking, ``delivery_confirmed`` and the SEL audit. This module
  deliberately does NOT re-spell any of that: a second copy drifts, dropping the
  audit and the confirmation check —
  so the only thing kept here is the one decision the shared helper does not
  make, which is skipping a PAUSED binding and continuing the ladder.

Both legs can fire for one note: a dashboard slot can hold a Slack thread link
and a non-Slack mirror at once, and each is a conversation with a user in it.

Best-effort by construction. The transcript line and the context entry are the
note's contract; a channel that is unreachable, paused, ungoverned or incapable
of a proactive send is logged and swallowed rather than failing the POST.

    Returns nothing, and neither do the legs. Whether a leg delivered is a fact
    only its own log line and SEL rows carry: this function's caller dispatches
    in the background and has no one to report to, so a return value here would
    be surface no production code can consume.

    Absorbs both a stall and a raise so neither can reach the caller, because the
    OTHER leg's delivery is still owed and because the endpoint dispatches this in
    the background -- an escaping exception there would surface only as an
    unhandled-task warning, never as anything a caller could act on. A stall and a
    raise are logged apart because they need different operator responses -- a live
    channel that stopped answering versus a composition or transport fault.

    *audit_timeout* and *audit_error* are supplied by the caller rather than chosen
    here, because the row belongs in the leg's OWN stream and only the caller holds
    that leg's identifiers. Branching on *leg* instead would put a second emitter in
    this module, which is the divergence ``audit_channel_send`` exists to avoid. Both
    endings file one, so neither terminates unaudited.

    SEQUENTIAL BY DESIGN, one leg after the other, and the reasons are the ones
    below: each leg carries its own bound, absorbs its own failure so the FIRST leg
    cannot stop the second, and records its own terminal outcome. Ordering is NOT
    standing in for the governance profile store's cold-load race -- the store
    serialises that itself, so a first-touch caller waits for the owner's load
    instead of being denied for the presence of a sibling.

    That fix is the store's because ordering here could never have covered it: each
    note is dispatched in its own task, so two notes written close together race the
    same load whatever one note does with its own two legs.

    *timeout* BOUNDS THE LEG at ``_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_S`` PER PROJECTED CHUNK rather than
    by one flat deadline, and there is no arm that disables it: a leg runs in a
    background task, so one that never returns is never discarded from the
    dispatcher's task set, and because the legs are sequential a leg that hangs also
    means the OTHER leg is never reached -- the note goes nowhere and the process
    keeps the task for its lifetime. Repeated notes then accumulate them.

    Bounding a chunk loop can leave a delivered PREFIX when the deadline fires. That
    prefix is not SILENT: ``_note_channel_text`` terminates every note that could SPLIT
    before the send reaches this deadline, so a truncated delivery is missing its end
    marker and a reader can tell three-of-eight from a note that was only ever three
    parts. A note too short to split needs none -- one part arrives whole or not at all.
    It is accepted here because a partial delivery is
    ALREADY the behaviour of both helpers a leg calls -- each aborts mid-send and
    returns failure when a binding is revoked between parts, leaving the parts
    already sent in place, and each says so in its own comment. So a partial note is
    a case this chain already handles and reports; a leg that never returns is not.

    Scaling the bound per chunk is what keeps it from being the flat deadline the
    earlier design rejected: a leg sending eight parts gets eight chunks' grace, so
    the bound only fires when a leg is genuinely not progressing rather than when it
    is merely long. That bound is the ONLY limit on a leg -- there is no second,
    up-front size refusal, because a capped note cannot project past it.

    map first and fell back to those attributes when the row was absent or partial,
    which left a real hole: clear or reassign the persisted row and the fallback
    resurrects the superseded slot binding, posting the note into a conversation the
    session has moved off. Falling back cannot distinguish "not written yet" from
    "deliberately cleared", so it cannot be done safely at all.

    The cost is a dashboard slot linked in this process before its row is written:
    its note does not reach Slack. That is the same answer this function already
    gives when the lookup RAISES, and for the same reason -- a binding we cannot
    read is one we cannot claim to have authorized, and a background note that goes
    nowhere is strictly cheaper than one that reaches the wrong audience.

    Slot fields are used ONLY when there is no session store at all, where they are
    the sole binding that exists rather than the older of two.
