"""Session tags — dynamic vocabulary CRUD, slot assignment, and sidebar columns.

Tags are user-defined labels (id/name/color/status) attached to dashboard chat
slots. Sessions can carry multiple tags. The sidebar renders as a horizontal
strip of user-configurable columns. A column filters either by a set of tags
(any/all/none mode) or by the session's live runtime lane — needs-approval,
waiting, working, idle — which is derived from the slot payload rather than
stored on the session. Dragging a session card between columns that carry a
single status tag as filter reassigns the card's status tag; a derived state
lane refuses the drop, because only the agent's own progress moves a card there.

    """Filter a folder's raw ``tags`` value down to usable tag ids.

    The definition of "a folder tag id a new chat may inherit" for the
    folder/inheritance paths, shared by the dashboard slot-create path
    (chat_handlers), the folder create/PATCH validation (chat_folders), the
    channel first-filing path, and the channel restore read (channel_slots)
    so an inheritance-rule change cannot land on one path and miss the
    others. (Three pre-existing slot-restore prunes elsewhere apply the same
    shape guards inline, and ``api_chat_slot_tags``'s strict inline filter is
    a fourth spelling differing only on the fail-open axis; consolidating all
    four onto this helper — likely via a strict-mode flag — is deliberately
    left to a follow-up. Those sites are outside this change.)
    Callers must invoke it AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION (immediately before the
    ids are written to a slot or persisted), never on a value resolved
    earlier — a tag deletion between resolve and apply would otherwise
    resurrect the deleted id.

    Two guard tiers, deliberately different in when they apply:

    * UNCONDITIONAL shape guards — ``raw`` must be a list (``folders.json``
      is hand-editable; anything else yields ``[]``), and each entry must be
      a string BEFORE the membership test (a non-string entry is unhashable
      and the test itself would raise, turning a malformed store row into a
      500 on every chat created in that folder). Order-preserving,
      de-duplicated.
    * AUTHORITY-GATED vocabulary intersection — DELEGATED to
      ``DashboardState.tag_ids_for_restore``, the one reader every restore path
      shares, which also holds the UNKNOWN-vs-KNOWN rule and why failing open is
      load-bearing. A dangling id kept that way is pruned on the next authoritative
      boot.

      Knownness therefore has exactly ONE encoding, ``_committed_tag_ids``, and this
      helper reads it through the same accessor as everything else — there is no
      second flag to keep in sync and no per-site spelling of the fail-open rule.
      The committed snapshot is also the correct SET to intersect against: live
      ``state._tags`` is a working copy that a mutation moves ahead of disk and a
      failed write restores, so validating against it can admit an id that never
      landed. In normal operation the two agree, because a tag write publishes the
      snapshot as soon as it confirms.

    """THE choke point for a confirmed tag-vocabulary write: persist, then publish.

    EVERY tag write in this module routes through here, with no exception. Publication is
    UNCONDITIONAL once the write confirms -- there is no knownness test in this helper,
    because by the time a write has landed the vocabulary IS known: these bytes are it.
    Knownness is decided at LOAD instead (``load_tags`` publishes only when the document
    parsed and the file exists), which is the only place the question is open.

    For every other path this makes "the committed vocabulary matches disk" a MECHANISM
    rather than a convention each new call site has to remember. The alternative is a
    publication per call site, which is what allows ``_mutate_tags_locked`` -- a
    confirmed-write helper in the same file -- to leave ``_committed_tag_ids`` stale
    while disk moves on. Staleness in the
    missing-a-live-id direction is the damaging one, because the adopt and restore paths
    PRUNE against this set: an id on disk but absent from the snapshot is stripped off
    the user's slots and the next save makes that loss durable. Mirrors
    ``mutate_folders`` on the folder side.

    Deliberately NOT inside ``_write_tags_snapshot``. That function is the sync body
    handed to ``asyncio.to_thread``, and the suites replace it wholesale to simulate a
    pop mid-write and an ``IOError`` -- so a publication living in there would be
    patched out exactly where the vocabulary matters most, and would also mutate state
    from a worker thread. Publishing HERE keeps it on the event loop and keeps the
    patched seam meaning what it says.

    ORDER IS THE POINT: ``save_tags_snapshot`` raises on failure, so publication is
    reached only when the bytes landed and *snapshot* IS the on-disk vocabulary. A
    failure leaves the committed set untouched, leaving each caller's own rollback to
    restore the live list.

    Publication is NOT gated on the vocabulary already being KNOWN. After a malformed
    ``tags.json`` the field is ``None``, and such a gate would skip the very write that
    ends the ignorance, leaving it ``None`` for the life of the process: every restore
    then fails open, and a tag deleted after that load is retained on resumed slots as a
    dangling id no sweep reaches. The loader itself fails open, which is correct there --
    it genuinely does not know what an unparsable file contains. ``mutate_folders``
    publishes on the same rule, so both vocabularies obey one.

    CANCELLATION-ATOMIC. ``asyncio.to_thread`` hands the body to a worker that cannot
    be interrupted, so cancelling the awaiting handler does NOT stop the write -- the
    bytes still land. Awaiting it bare therefore loses the publication on cancellation:
    disk moves to *snapshot* while ``_committed_tag_ids`` keeps the old set, which is
    the exact missing-a-live-id staleness this helper exists to prevent, and the
    fork/restore validators then prune a valid assignment. The protocol that answers
    this -- shield, publish as a statement on both exits, drain under the lock -- lives in
    ONE place, ``commit_snapshot_while_holding_the_lock``, which the folder store calls too
    so the two vocabularies cannot drift apart.

    No ``rollback`` is passed: this helper's caller (``_mutate_tags_locked``) restores
    ``state._tags`` on ``except Exception``, and the shared helper propagates the
    write's own failure rather than the cancellation precisely so that arm is reached.
