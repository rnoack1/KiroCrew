"""The shared snapshot-commit choreography for the dashboard's vocabulary stores.

A LEAF module on purpose. Both vocabulary stores (folders and tags) need this protocol,
so it cannot live in either of them without one importing the other; and it cannot live in
``chat_persistence`` either, because the folder store importing that module closes a cycle
back through ``chat_utils``. Depending on nothing but :mod:`asyncio` is what keeps it
importable from both sides.

The shield-drain-reraise loop is defined ONCE here, in ``drain_shielded``, and every caller
in the tree uses it -- both exported functions below and ``chat_utils.run_config_write``,
which guards a config write rather than a vocabulary commit. Only the DRAIN is shared: each
caller still derives its own outcome, because they differ (one re-raises the sweep's failure,
one also owes a publication, one returns the write's result). That split is what let the third
spelling be folded in without widening publish-on-both-exits onto a caller that does not want
it.

    ONE definition of the whole choreography, shared by both vocabulary stores: a
    hand-synced cancellation protocol per store would drift toward silent data loss, so
    everything the two sites do differently is a parameter rather than a copy.

    ``asyncio.to_thread`` hands the body to a worker that cannot be interrupted, so a
    cancelled handler still lands the bytes. Three consequences, each handled here:

    * Awaiting bare would lose the PUBLICATION -- disk moves on while the committed set
      keeps the old value -- so publication is an explicit statement on BOTH exits,
      never a done-callback. A callback is scheduled with ``call_soon``, so a
      cancellation racing the write's completion unwinds through the caller while the
      callback is still queued, and the caller's sweep decision reads the pre-removal
      committed set.
    * ``shield`` re-raises immediately, so returning would release the caller's lock
      with the worker still writing and let a later mutation be overwritten by this
      older worker finishing last. Hence the drain.
    * ``CancelledError`` is not an ``Exception``, so a caller's ``except Exception``
      never sees it. When the drain reports the write FAILED, the write's own error is
      raised INSTEAD of the cancellation -- which is what puts a plain
      ``except Exception`` at the call site back in reach of the failure.

    ROLLBACK IS THE CALLER'S, deliberately: both call sites already hold the
    pre-mutation copy and both recover in an ``except Exception`` of their own, so a
    ``rollback`` parameter here would be a second spelling of a decision the caller is
    better placed to make. A WRITE FAILURE SUPERSEDES THE CANCELLATION: when the drain
    reports the write failed, that error is raised in the cancellation's place, so the
    caller's plain ``except Exception`` is reached exactly when a restore is owed.
    Otherwise -- the shielded write SUCCEEDED -- the cancellation is re-raised as-is and
    ``except Exception`` does not see it, which is correct: the bytes landed, so there is
    nothing to restore.

    A genuine write failure on the NON-cancelled path needs no arm of its own here: it
    propagates from the ``await`` untouched, and the caller restores. Only the cancelled
    path is special-cased, because that is the one where the failure would otherwise go
    unseen.
