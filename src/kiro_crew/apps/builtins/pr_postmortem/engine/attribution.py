"""Attribute a fix PR back to the PR that introduced the bug.

Mechanically, not by guesswork:

1. Take the fix's landed commit ``F``. Its first parent ``F^`` is the exact tree
   the bug lived in.
2. Diff ``F^..F`` at zero context to get the *pre-image* lines the fix deleted or
   rewrote (see :mod:`engine.diffparse`).
3. ``git blame`` those line ranges at ``F^``. Each line names the commit that
   last wrote it.
4. Map those commits to their PRs and rank by weighted attributed lines.

The output carries its own evidence and caveats: attribution is a heuristic, and
a report that cannot show which lines produced its verdict is not reviewable.
